Most COVID-19 cases published were in the third trimester of pregnancy, which could reflect reporting bias, higher risk of infection or increased disease severity in late pregnancy. Seroprevalence studies may allow reliable estimates of the susceptibility to infection and clinical spectrum since they include asymptomatic and mild infections not tested for PCR. We evaluated the seroprevalence and clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnant women in the first and third trimester. Methods: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each institution and informed consent was obtained. We recruited 874 consecutive pregnancies attending for first trimester screening (10-16 weeks of gestation, n=372) or delivery (n=502) from April 14 to May 5. All women were interviewed with a structured questionnaire for COVID-19 symptoms two months prior to sampling. SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM/IgA antibodies were tested (COVID-19 VIRCLIA Monotest, Vircell Microbiologist, Spain; reported sensitivity 70% IgG and 89% IgM/IgA, and specificity 89% and 99% respectively). Indeterminate results were re-tested (VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-SARS-CoV2 Total Tests, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, USA; 100% sensitivity and specificity) and re-classified as positive or negative. Women with COVID-19 were diagnosed and managed according to standard protocols and guidelines3,4. Statistical differences were tested using the {chi}2 test or Student t-test as appropriate (p<0.05). Results: A total of 125 of 874 women (14.3%) were positive for either IgG or IgM/IgA SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 54/372 (14.5%) in the first and 71/502 (14.1%) in the third trimester. A total of 75/125 (60%) reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in the past 2 months, whereas 44 (35.2%) reported one or more symptoms, of which 31 (24.8%) had at least 3 symptoms or anosmia and 8 (6.4%) dyspnea. Overall, 7 women (5.6%) were admitted for persistent fever despite paracetamol and dyspnea, of which 3 had signs of pneumonia on chest radiography. All 3 had criteria for severity (bilateral chest condensation, respiratory rate>30 and leukopenia) and required oxygen support but not critical care or mechanical ventilation, and they were all discharged well. The rates of symptomatic infection, hospital admission or dyspnea were significantly higher in third trimester women (Table and Figure). Discussion: The 14.3% seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 in pregnant women in this study was substantially larger than the contemporary rates of PCR positive cases (0.78%) reported for women 20-40y in Barcelona. The data confirm that COVID-19 is asymptomatic in the majority of pregnant women6 and illustrate the value of seroprevalence studies to capture the high proportion of asymptomatic or mild infections. In this study, none of the 125 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection required critical care as compared to 9% reported in cases diagnosed with PCR. However, the proportion of infections with symptoms or dyspnea was remarkably higher in the third trimester, and these results are in line with COVID-19 registries, reporting that 81% of hospitalized women were in late pregnancy or peripartum. These results provide reassuring information that, even in settings with a high prevalence, SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy mostly presents with asymptomatic or mild clinical forms. The susceptibility to infection seemed to be the same in the first and the third trimesters of gestation. The data further suggest that, as with other respiratory viruses, COVID-19 could be more severe and require increased surveillance in late pregnancy. These findings should be confirmed and extended with larger consecutive prevalence studies in pregnancy.",2020-06-19,"Crovetto, F.; Crispi, F.; Llurba, E.; Figueras, F.; Gomez-Roig, M.

GSH acts as a nucleophilic scavenger and as an enzyme-catalyzed antioxidant in the event of electrophilic/oxidative tissue injury. Therefore, GSH has a major role as a protector of biological structures and functions. GSH depletion has been recognized as a hazardous condition during paracetamol intoxication. Conversely, GSH rescue, meaning recovery of the protective potential of GSH by early administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), has been found to be life-saving. Lack of GSH and electrophilic/oxidative injury have been identified among the causes of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Experimental and early clinical data (in ARDS) point to the role of NAC in the treatment of these conditions. Recently, orally given NAC has been shown to enhance the levels of GSH in the liver, in plasma, and notably in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

Morphological alterations in the tracheal epithelium and a potentiation of the inflammatory response evoked by sensory nerve stimulation (“neurogenic inflammation”) are evident nine weeks after the infections begin, but the extent to which these changes are present at earlier times is not known. In the present study we characterized these abnormalities in the epithelium and determined the extent to which they are present 3 and 6 weeks after the infections begin. We also determined the magnitude of the potentiation of neurogenic inflammation at these times, whether the potentiation can be reversed by glucocorticoids, and whether a proliferation of blood vessels contributes to the abnormally large amount of plasma extravasation associated with this potentiation. To this end, we studied Long-Evans rats that acquired these viral and mycoplasmal infections from other rats. We found that the tracheal epithelium of the infected rats had ten times as many Alcian blue-PAS positive mucous cells as did that of pathogen-free rats; but it contained none of the serous cells typical of pathogen-free rats, so the total number of secretory cells was not increased. In addition, the epithelium of the infected rats had three times the number of ciliated cells and had only a third of the number of globule leukocytes. In response to an injection of capsaicin (150 μg/kg i.v.), the tracheas of the infected rats developed an abnormally large amount of extravasation of two tracers Evans blue dye and Monastral blue pigment, and had an abnormally large number of Monastral blue-labeled venules, particularly in regions of mucosa overlying the cartilaginous rings. This abnormally large amount of extravasation was blocked by dexamethasone (1 mg/day i.p. for 5 days). We conclude that M. pulmonis infections, exacerbated at the outset by viral infections, result within three weeks in the transformation of epithelial serous cells into mucous cells, the proliferation of ciliated cells, and the depletion of globule leukocytes. They also cause a proliferation of mediator-sensitive blood vessels in the airway mucosa, which is likely to contribute to the potentiation of neurogenic inflammation that accompanies these infections.",1989,"Huang, Hung-Tu; Haskell, Amy; McDonald, Donald M.",Anat Embryol (Berl),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/76631b595a3ee03bc6f6d83d6ed286540748ca86.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2552865/,21868960

Injection of carrageenan into the pleural cavity elicited an acute inflammatory response characterized by protein rich fluid accumulation and leukocyte infiltration in the pleural cavity. The peak inflammatory response was obtained at 24 h when the fluid volume, protein concentration, C-reactive protein and cell infiltration were maximums. The results showed that these parameters were attenuated by HCI at any dose and touched bottom at dose of 0.54 ml/100 g, although less strong than dexamethasone.

We also examined measures taken by the residency and fellowship programs to protect their residents and fellows, and measures taken by regulatory agencies like the ACGME and the ABOS to give programs some flexibility during these difficult times. Conclusion Orthopaedic and neurosurgery residents and fellows are often on the front lines of patient care. Programs have to ensure adequate resources and training, supervision, and work hour requirements are met. Residents and fellows need to be ready to assist with management of COVID-19 patients if necessary.

This prospective observational study aimed to assess the microorganisms associated with pneumonia in children aged <5 years in developing and emerging countries. METHODS: A multicenter, case-control study by the GABRIEL (Global Approach to Biological Research, Infectious diseases and Epidemics in Low-income countries) network was conducted between 2010 and 2014 in Cambodia, China, Haiti, India (2 sites), Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, and Paraguay. Cases were hospitalized children with radiologically confirmed pneumonia; controls were children from the same setting without any features suggestive of pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from all subjects; 19 viruses and 5 bacteria were identified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Associations between microorganisms and pneumonia were quantified by calculating the adjusted population attributable fraction (aPAF) after multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, time period, other pathogens, and site. RESULTS: Overall, 888 cases and 870 controls were analyzed; ≥1 microorganism was detected in respiratory samples in 93.0% of cases and 74.4% of controls (P < .001). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 1, 3, and 4, and influenza virus A and B were independently associated with pneumonia; aPAF was 42.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 35.5%–48.2%) for S. pneumoniae, 18.2% (95% CI, 17.4%–19.0%) for RSV, and 11.2% (95% CI, 7.5%–14.7%) for rhinovirus.

In the discovery phase of analysis, pooled sera collected at week 0 and at each week p.i. to week 12 were fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography and the protein mass fingerprints obtained in individual fractions were in the M/z range 1.5–150kDa. A total of 2302 protein clusters (peaks) were identified that varied between time-points following infection with peaks increasing or decreasing in intensity, or showing transient variation in intensity, during the 12 weeks of parasite challenge. In the validation phase, candidate biomarkers in sera of individual sheep at weeks 3 and 9 p.i. were analysed, identifying 100 protein peaks, many of which are small peptides <10kDa in size: 54% of these peaks were up-regulated in intensity at week 3 or 9 p.i. Twenty-six biomarkers were chosen for further study, ranging in size from 1832 to 89,823Da: six biomarkers were up-regulated at weeks 3 and 9 p.i., 16 biomarkers were up-regulated only at week 9 p.i. and four biomarkers were down-regulated at week 9 p.i. Two biomarkers up-regulated at week 9 were identified as transferrin (77.2kDa) and Apolipoprotein A-IV (44.3kDa), respectively. The results show that the interaction between the host and F. hepatica is complex, with changes in biomarker patterns beginning within 3 weeks of infection and either persisting to weeks 9–12 or showing transient changes during infection.

Xiao and DA (three types of DA identified) were found to have been derived from several donor sites and have spread to 30 loci in the human genome, totaling to 5 Mb. Our bioinformatics analyses with the released human, chimp, rhesus macaque, orangutan, and marmoset genomic sequences indicate that DA and Xiao emerged ~25 million years (Myr) ago. RESULTS: To better understand the evolution of these two complex elements, we investigated various internal junctions of DA and Xiao as well as orthologous genomic sites of the 30 DA/Xiao loci in non-human primates including great apes, lesser apes, Old World monkeys, New World monkeys, and a prosimian. We found that Xiao and type I DA first emerged in the genome between 25 and 18 Myr ago, whereas type II and Type III DAs emerged between 14 and 7 Myr ago. Xiao and DA were most active in great apes, with their amplification peaking during 25-14 and 14-7 Myr ago, respectively. Neither DA nor Xiao seem to have been active in the human and chimp genomes during last 6 Myr. CONCLUSION: The study has led to a more accurate age determination of the DA and Xiao elements than our previous bioinformatics analyses, and indicates that the amplification activity of the elements coincided with that of group I HERV-Es during evolution. It has also illustrated an evolutionary path with stepwise structural changes for the elements during past 25 Myr, and in doing so has shed more light on these two intriguing and complex elements that have reshaped our genome.",2009-06-05,"Li, Xuanyang; Slife, Jennifer; Patel, Neil; Zhao, Shaying",BMC Evol Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3a2fe662fce281e831bf7706e83d7b399b367167.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2700803.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19500371/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-9-128,13103348

The well-established quarantine measures for nonhuman primates and those that have re-emerged for rodents are very important. The increased use and exchange of genetically engineered mutant mice especially demands rodent quarantine capabilities for the majority of research institutions. Apart from species-specific housing requirements, it is important to consider pathogens to be contained in terms of the route of transmission, and degree of hazard to human and animal health. Animals obtained from commercial vendors, as opposed to other research institutions, may be less likely to harbor undesirable microorganisms, often allowing them to be exempt from a quarantine program.

The ultimate goal of the MLSCN and the MLI is to expand the availability, flexibility, and use of small-molecule chemical probes for basic research. A number of aspects of the MLSCN make this initiative unique from other academic screening center. First, all researchers have access to the screening centers through the NIH X01 and R03 funding mechanisms. Second, because of the diverse source of assays and the wide expertise available within the MSLCN, specific biological systems investigated and screened will include: (1) “high risk” targets—that is, proteins or biological systems whose function is unknown; (2) targets implicated in orphan diseases or diseases not typically addressed by the private sector; (3) novel or uncommon assay systems; and (4) “non-druggable” targets, such as inhibitors of aggregation and protein–protein interactions. Third, the small molecule screening library contains structures not typically found in commercial collections or those housed in pharmaceutical companies. Fourth, as the goal of the MLSCN is to develop selective chemical probes and small molecule tools that will interrogate novel biochemical pathways, the criteria for an acceptable class of molecules is broader for the MLSCN than for those involved in drug discovery and development.

Several coronaviruses, such as Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are of medical importance, with high mortality rates and, in the case of SARS-CoV, significant pandemic potential. Other coronaviruses, such as Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and Avian coronavirus, are important livestock pathogens. Ribosome profiling is a technique which exploits the capacity of the translating ribosome to protect around 30 nucleotides of mRNA from ribonuclease digestion. Ribosome-protected mRNA fragments are purified, subjected to deep sequencing and mapped back to the transcriptome to give a global “snap-shot” of translation. Parallel RNA sequencing allows normalization by transcript abundance. Here we apply ribosome profiling to cells infected with Murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59), a model coronavirus in the same genus as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The data obtained allowed us to study the kinetics of virus transcription and translation with exquisite precision. We studied the timecourse of positive and negative-sense genomic and subgenomic viral RNA production and the relative translation efficiencies of the different virus ORFs. Virus mRNAs were not found to be translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; rather, virus translation dominates host translation at later time points due to high levels of virus transcripts. Triplet phasing of the profiling data allowed precise determination of translated reading frames and revealed several translated short open reading frames upstream of, or embedded within, known virus protein-coding regions. Ribosome pause sites were identified in the virus replicase polyprotein pp1a ORF and investigated experimentally.

Results Totally 147 patients with COVID-19 were included. The median duration of viral shedding (the number of days from symptoms onset till the successive negative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA) was 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 12 to 21).

Governments have implemented combinations of ‘lockdown’ measures of various stringencies, including school and workplace closures, cancellations of public events, and restrictions on internal and external movements. These policy interventions are an attempt to shield high risk individuals and to prevent overwhelming countries’ healthcare systems, or, colloquially, ‘flatten the curve’. However, these policy interventions may come with physical and psychological health harms, group and social harms, and opportunity costs. These policies may particularly affect vulnerable populations and not only exacerbate pre-existing inequities, but also generate new ones. Methods We developed a conceptual framework to identify and categorise adverse effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures. We based our framework on Lorenc and Oliver’s framework for the adverse effects of public health interventions and the PROGRESS-Plus equity framework. To test its application we purposively sampled COVID-19 policy examples from around the world and evaluated them for the potential physical, psychological, and social harms, as well as opportunity costs, in each of the PROGRESS-Plus equity domains: Place of residence, Race/ethnicity, Occupation, Gender/sex, Religion, Education, Socioeconomic status, Social capital, Plus (age, and disability). Results We found examples of inequitably distributed adverse effects for each COVID-19 lockdown policy example, stratified by LMIC and HIC, in every PROGRESS-Plus equity domain. We identified known policy interventions intended to mitigate some of these adverse effects. The same harms (anxiety; depression; food insecurity; loneliness; stigma; violence) appear to be repeated across many groups, and are exacerbated by several COVID-19 policy interventions. Conclusion Our conceptual framework highlights the fact that COVID-19 policy interventions can generate or exacerbate interactive and multiplicative equity harms. Applying this framework can help in three ways: (1) identifying areas where a policy intervention may generate inequitable adverse effects; (2) mitigating policy and practice interventions by facilitating the systematic examination of relevant evidence; and (3) planning for lifting COVID-19 lockdowns and policy interventions around the world.",2020-06-09,"Glover, Rebecca E.; van Schalkwyk, May CI.; Akl, Elie A.; Kristjannson, Elizabeth; Lotfi, Tamara; Petkovic, Jennifer; Petticrew, Mark P.; Pottie, Kevin; Tugwell, Peter; Welch, Vivian",J Clin Epidemiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0333b149fa1bad7b40013227fa125d7a90745265.json,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435620305977?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.06.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32526461/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895435620305977,219534600

Its role in respiratory diseases was questioned after the detection of its DNA in clinical samples taken from patients suffering from pneumonia or bronchiolitis. To better define the role of Waddlia in both miscarriage and pneumonia, a tool allowing large-scale serological investigations of Waddlia seropositivity is needed. Therefore, enriched outer membrane proteins of W. chondrophila were used as antigens to develop a specific ELISA. After thorough analytical optimization, the ELISA was validated by comparison with micro-immunofluorescence and it showed a sensitivity above 85% with 100% specificity. The ELISA was subsequently applied to human sera to specify the role of W. chondrophila in pneumonia. Overall, 3.6% of children showed antibody reactivity against W. chondrophila but no significant difference was observed between children with and without pneumonia. Proteomic analyses were then performed using mass spectrometry, highlighting members of the outer membrane protein family as the dominant proteins. The major Waddlia putative immunogenic proteins were identified by immunoblot using positive and negative human sera. The new ELISA represents an efficient tool with high throughput applications.

The detection of both antigens and antibodies in SARS‐CoV from human specimens with suspected SARS plays an important role in preventing infection. We developed a novel rapid immunochromatographic test (RICT) based on the sandwich format enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with an all‐in‐one device for detecting the native nucleocapsid antigen (N‐Ag) of SARS‐CoV using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), which we produced by immunizing recombinant N‐Ag to mice. RICT is a qualitative assay for respiratory aspirates and serum specimens. With this assay, a positive result can be judged subjectively by the appearance of a blue line on the device 15 min after the sample is applied. RICT with several pairs of MoAbs showed a high sensitivity for the detection of recombinant N‐Ag as well as viral N‐Ag of SARS‐CoV. rSN122 and rSN21‐2 were the best MoAbs for immobilized antibody and enzyme labeling, respectively. With regard to analytical sensitivity, RICT detected N‐Ag at 31 pg/mL for recombinant N‐Ag, and at 1.99×10(2) TCID(50)/mL for SARS‐CoV. The specificity of RICT was 100% when 150 human sera and 50 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NSPs) were used. RICT based on an EIA using the rSN122/rSN21‐2 pair is a sensitive, specific, and reliable rapid assay for detecting N‐Ag in SARS‐CoV treated with either heat or Triton X‐100. J. Clin. Lab.

Canine and feline parvoviruses cause an acute enteric disease in their hosts, with high level of viral shedding. In this study, a quantitative TaqMan PCR for detection and quantitation of canine and feline parvoviruses in serum and fecal samples was developed. The primers were designed based upon the entire GenBank content for CPV and FPLV. A standard curve was generated, and validation tests were performed using 10-fold serial dilutions of CPV-2 virus in CPV/FPLV-negative feces and CPV/FPLV-negative serum samples. As a result, the 100% detection limit of the PCR was 18 copies of the viral genome per μl of serum and fecal sample. All canine parvovirus types as well as FPLV were detected.

Besides unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and genetic susceptibility, environmental pollutants also contribute to the rising prevalence of obesity epidemic. An environmental obesogen is defined as a chemical that can alter lipid homeostasis to promote adipogenesis and lipid accumulation whereas an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) is defined as a synthetic chemical that can interfere with the endocrine function and cause adverse health effects. Many obesogens are EDCs that interfere with normal endocrine regulation of metabolism, adipose tissue development and maintenance, appetite, weight and energy balance. An expanding body of scientific evidence from animal and epidemiological studies has begun to provide links between exposure to EDCs and obesity. Despite the significance of environmental obesogens in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, the contribution of synthetic chemical exposure to obesity epidemic remains largely unrecognised. Hence, the purpose of this review is to provide a current update on the evidences from animal and human studies on the role of fourteen environmental obesogens in obesity, a comprehensive view of the mechanisms of action of these obesogens and current green and sustainable chemistry strategies to overcome chemical exposure to prevent obesity. Designing of safer version of obesogens through green chemistry approaches requires a collaborative undertaking to evaluate the toxicity of endocrine disruptors using appropriate experimental methods, which will help in developing a new generation of inherently safer chemicals.",2020-06-30,"Gupta, Radhika; Kumar, Prashant; Fahmi, Nighat; Garg, Bhaskar; Dutta, Sriparna; Sachar, Shilpee; Matharu, Avtar S.; Vimaleswaran, Karani S.",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3641ed2538375b20abace5144f640eece948a1fa.json,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666086520300126?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666086520300126,220267375

The importance of H. somni diseases can be attributed to improved clinical and laboratory recognition, combined with the growth in intensive management practices for cattle. Although outbreaks of bovine histophilosis can occur year-round, in northern and southern hemispheres, it is most frequent in late fall and early winter. Weather, stress, dietary changes, and comingling of cattle are likely to be major triggers for outbreaks. The most frequent clinical expressions of histophilosis include undifferentiated fever, fibrinosuppurative pneumonia, encephalitis-leptomeningitis, necrotizing myocarditis, and diffuse pleuritis. Neurological disease occurs either as thrombotic meningoencephalitis (TME) or as suppurative meningitis with ventriculitis. Acute myocarditis is characteristically necrotizing and generally involves one or both papillary muscles in the left ventricular myocardium. Biofilm-like aggregates of bacteria occur in capillaries and veins in myocardium, in the central nervous system, and on endocardial surfaces. H. somni is a component of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex. In our experience, it is most commonly diagnosed in subacute-to-chronic polymicrobial pulmonary infections in combination with Mannheimia haemolytica, Trueperella pyogenes, Pasteurella multocida, or Mycoplasma bovis. Other, less common forms of H. somni disease present as polyarthritis/tenosynovitis, abortion with placentitis and fetal septicemia, epididymitis-orchitis, and ocular infections. It is likely that H. somni is under-recognized clinically and diagnostically. Most state and provincial laboratories in North America rely on bacterial isolation to confirm infection. The use of more sensitive detection methods on field cases of histophilosis will help resolve the pathogenesis of H. somni in natural outbreaks, and whether the disease is as common elsewhere as it is in Canada.",2016-01-29,"O’Toole, D.; Sondgeroth, K.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection caused more than half of the deaths due to cirrhosis in the region, followed by alcohol consumption (20·8%), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; 12·1%), and chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV; 15·7%). In 2015, HBV accounted for about half the cases of hepatocellular carcinoma in the region. Preventive strategies for viral hepatitis-related liver disease include increasing access to clean drinking water and sanitation. HBV vaccination programmes for neonates have been implemented by all countries, although birth-dose coverage is extremely suboptimal in some. Availability of screening tests for blood and tissue, donor recall policies, and harm reduction strategies are in their initial stages in most countries. Many governments have put HBV and HCV drugs on their essential medicines lists and the availability of generic versions of these drugs has reduced costs. Efforts to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat, together with the rapid increase in per-capita alcohol consumption in countries and the epidemic of obesity, are expected to change the spectrum of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region in the near future. The increasing burden of alcohol-related liver diseases can be contained through government policies to limit consumption and promote less harmful patterns of alcohol use, which are in place in some countries but need to be enforced more strictly. Steps are needed to control obesity and NAFLD, including policies to promote healthy lifestyles and regulate the food industry. Inadequate infrastructure and insufficient health-care personnel trained in liver diseases are issues that also need to be addressed in the Asia-Pacific region.

While a constrained form of consequentialism might provide a justification for such public health interventions, we argue that a stronger justification is provided by a principle of State Enforced Easy Rescue: a state may permissibly compel individuals to engage in activities that entail a small cost to them but a large benefit to others, because individuals have a moral duty of easy rescue to engage in those activities. The principle of State Enforced Easy Rescue gives rise to an Obligation Enforcement Requirement: the state should create the conditions such that submitting to coercive or compulsive measures becomes a fundamental moral duty of individuals, i.e. a duty of easy rescue. When the state can create such conditions, it has the strongest justification possible for implementing coercive or compulsive measures, because individuals have a moral duty to temporarily relinquish the rights that such measures would infringe.

However, the inability to cryopreserve embryos significantly reduces its broader application, and as such limits the capacity to utilize elite genetic resources internationally. In addition, cryopreservation of the semen of camelids is also difficult, suggesting an extreme sensitivity of the germplasm to cooling and freezing. As a result, genetic resources of camelids must continue to be maintained as living collections of animals. Due to concerns over disease outbreaks such as that of the highly pathogenic Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the Middle East and Asia, there is an urgent need to establish an effective gene banking system for camelid species, especially the camel. The current review compares and summarizes recent progress in the field of camelid embryo cryopreservation, identifying four possible reasons for the slow development of an effective protocol and describing eight future directions to improve the current protocols.

The hallmark of T(regs) is the expression of the forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) transcription factor. Natural regulatory T cells (nT(regs)) are a distinct population of T cells that express CD4 and FoxP3. nTregs develop in the thymus and function in maintaining peripheral immune tolerance. Other CD4(+), CD4(-)CD8(-), and CD8(+)CD28(-) T cells can be induced to acquire regulatory function by antigenic stimulation, depending on the cytokine milieu. Inducible (or adaptive) T(regs) frequently express high levels of the interleukin 2 receptor (CD25). Atypical T(regs) express FoxP3 and CD4 but have no surface expression of CD25. Type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1 cells) produce IL-10, while T helper 3 cells (Th3) produce TGF-β. The function of inducible T(regs) is presumably to maintain immune homeostasis, especially in the context of chronic inflammation or infection. Induction of T(regs) in coronaviral infections protects against the more severe forms of the disease attributable to the host response. However, arteriviruses have exploited these T cell subsets as a means to dampen the immune response allowing for viral persistence.

METHODS: RVFV-N protein was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and purified by histidine-tag based affinity chromatography. This recombinant RVFV-N (rRVFV-N) protein was then used as antigen to develop an IgG sandwich ELISA and IgM capture ELISAs for human sera. Ninety six serum samples collected from healthy volunteers during the RVF surveillance programme in Kenya in 2013, and 93 serum samples collected from RVF-suspected patients during the 2006–2007 RVF outbreak in Kenya were used respectively, to evaluate the newly established rRVFV-N protein-based IgG sandwich ELISA and IgM capture ELISA systems in comparison with the inactivated virus-based ELISA systems.

The viral solutions were exposed on glass samples uniformly loaded with copper and silver compounds. Exposure to solid-state cuprous oxide (Cu2O) efficiently inactivated both influenza A virus and bacteriophage Qβ, whereas solid-state cupric oxide (CuO) and silver sulfide (Ag2S) showed little antiviral activity. Copper ions from copper chloride (CuCl2) had little effect on the activity of bacteriophage Qβ in spite of the fact that copper ions strongly inactivate influenza A in previous studies. Silver ions from silver nitrate (AgNO3) and silver(I) oxide (Ag2O) in solution showed strong inactivation of influenza A and weak inactivation of bacteriophage Qβ. We also investigated the influence of the compounds on the function of two influenza viral proteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Silver ions from AgNO3 and Ag2O remarkably decreased enzymatic activity of neuraminidase through the breakage of disulfide (SS) bonds, corresponding to the selective inactivation of influenza A virus. By contrast, exposure to Cu2O markedly reduced the activity of hemagglutinin rather than neuraminidase. These findings suggest that solid-state Cu2O disrupts host cell recognition by denaturing protein structures on viral surfaces, leading to the inactivation of viruses regardless of the presence of a viral envelope.",2016-07-15,"Minoshima, Masafumi; Lu, Yue; Kimura, Takuto; Nakano, Ryuichi; Ishiguro, Hitoshi; Kubota, Yoshinobu; Hashimoto, Kazuhito; Sunada, Kayano",Journal of Hazardous Materials,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d517082c9dae1f5b30eafc462aca1b91c812203c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116991.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27015373/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389416302382; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.03.023; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389416302382,33109305

DATA SOURCES: Published experimental studies and clinical papers that address varied aspects of ventilator-induced lung injury pathogenesis and its consequences. STUDY SELECTION: Published information relevant to the novel hypothesis of progressive lung vulnerability and to the biophysical responses of lung injury and repair. DATA EXTRACTION: None. DATA SYNTHESIS: In acute respiratory distress syndrome, the reduced size and capacity for gas exchange of the functioning “baby lung” imply loss of ventilatory capability that dwindles in proportion to severity of lung injury. Concentrating the entire ventilation workload and increasing perfusion to these already overtaxed units accentuates their potential for progressive injury. Unlike static airspace pressures, which, in theory, apply universally to aerated structures of all dimensions, the components of tidal inflation that relate to power (which include frequency and flow) progressively intensify their tissue-stressing effects on parenchyma and microvasculature as the ventilated compartment shrinks further, especially during the first phase of the evolving injury. This “ventilator-induced lung injury vortex” of the shrinking baby lung is opposed by reactive, adaptive, and reparative processes. In this context, relatively little attention has been paid to the evolving interactions between lung injury and response and to the timing of interventions that worsen, limit or reverse a potentially accelerating ventilator-induced lung injury process. Although universal and modifiable drivers hold the potential to progressively injure the functional lung units of acute respiratory distress syndrome in a positive feedback cycle, measures can be taken to interrupt that process and encourage growth and healing of the “baby lung” of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.",2020-05-11,"Marini, John J.; Gattinoni, Luciano",Crit Care Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c058c1cc2bd467dbf449cac2869569c7d07d444b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217130.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32392018/; https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004416,218584724

NiV has been placed along with Hendra virus in genus Henipavirus of family Paramyxoviridae. Fruit bats (Genus Pteropus) are known to be natural host and reservoir of NiV. During the outbreaks from Malaysia and Singapore, the roles of pigs as intermediate host were confirmed. The infection transmitted from bats to pigs and subsequently from pigs to humans. Severe encephalitis was reported in NiV infection often associated with neurological disorders. First NiV outbreak in India occurred in Siliguri district of West Bengal in 2001, where direct transmission of the NiV virus from bats‐to‐human and human‐to‐human was reported in contrast to the role of pigs in the Malaysian NiV outbreak. Regular NiV outbreaks have been reported from Bangladesh since 2001 to 2015. The latest outbreak of NiV has been recorded in May, 2018 from Kerala, India which resulted in the death of 17 individuals.

Here, we describe the response of the blood service, the impact on blood donation and the effects on the blood supply in Hong Kong posed by the earlier SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003. The infection, like SARS‐CoV‐2 was highly contagious through droplet transmission. In the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, donor and staff safety was secured by using stringent infection control measures to protect both donors and staff from contacting the virus. All the donors were requested to wear face masks within the donation venue and use an alcohol‐based hand rinse. The donors' body temperature was checked before donation and staff's body temperatures were checked daily. The safety of the blood supply was secured by a donor deferral policy for 4 weeks following contact with a confirmed or suspected case of and a post‐donation call‐back system. Despite scheduling mobile donation sessions and a decrease in donors attending blood donor centers, the blood supply was maintained as there was a 12.8% reduction of the demand of blood and only a 16.9% reduction in the blood donation. Lessons learnt during the epidemic may help preparation for future epidemics and provide a basis for understanding the pathogenesis, laboratory diagnosis and role of coronaviruses in transfusion medicine.

The emergence and global spread of the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus have raised questions regarding the protective effect of available seasonal vaccines and the efficacy of a newly produced matched vaccine. Methods. Ferrets were immunized with the 2008–2009 formulations of commercially available live attenuated (FluMist; MedImmune) or split-inactivated (Fluviral; GlaxoSmithKline) vaccines, a commercial swine vaccine (FluSure; Pfizer), or a laboratory-produced matched inactivated whole-virus vaccine (A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009). Adaptive immune responses were monitored, and the animals were challenged with A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009 after 5 weeks. Results. Only animals that received the swine or matched vaccines developed detectable hemagglutination- inhibiting antibodies against the challenge virus, whereas a T cell response was exclusively detected in animals vaccinated with FluMist. After challenge, all animals had high levels of virus replication in the upper respiratory tract. However, preexisting anti—pandemic H1N1 2009 antibodies resulted in reduced clinical signs and improved survival. Surprisingly, FluMist was associated with a slight increase in mortality and greater lung damage, which correlated with early up-regulation of interleukin-10. Conclusions. The present study demonstrates that a single dose of matched inactivated vaccine confers partial protection against a pandemic H1N1 2009 virus, and it suggests that a higher dose or prime-boost regimen may be required.

These interactions mediate both the traffic of inflammatory cells and virus-associated immune responses. In the context of viral infections, the human C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) receives great attention from the scientific community due to its role as an HIV-1 co-receptor. The genetic variant CCR5Δ32 (32 base-pair deletion in CCR5 gene) impairs CCR5 expression on the cell surface and is associated with protection against HIV infection in homozygous individuals. Also, the genetic variant CCR5Δ32 modifies the CCR5-mediated inflammatory responses in various conditions, such as inflammatory and infectious diseases. CCR5 antagonists mimic, at least in part, the natural effects of the CCR5Δ32 in humans, which explains the growing interest in the potential benefits of using CCR5 modulators for the treatment of different diseases. Nevertheless, beyond HIV infection, understanding the effects of the CCR5Δ32 variant in multiple viral infections is essential to shed light on the potential effects of the CCR5 modulators from a broader perspective. In this context, this review discusses the involvement of CCR5 and the effects of the CCR5Δ32 in human infections caused by the following pathogens: West Nile virus, Influenza virus, Human papillomavirus, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, Poliovirus, Dengue virus, Human cytomegalovirus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Enterovirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Hantavirus. Subsequently, this review addresses the impacts of CCR5 gene editing and CCR5 modulation on health and viral diseases. Also, this article connects recent findings regarding extracellular vesicles (e.g., exosomes), viruses, and CCR5.

To produce the virus‐like particle (VLP) vaccine, we previously constructed recombinant baculoviruses to co‐express EV71 P1 polypeptide and 3CD protease using the Bac‐to‐Bac(®) vector system. The recombinant baculoviruses resulted in P1 cleavage by 3CD and subsequent VLP assembly in infected insect cells, but caused either low VLP yield or excessive VLP degradation. To tackle the problems, here we explored various expression cassette designs and flashBAC GOLD™ vector system which was deficient in v‐cath and chiA genes. We found that the recombinant baculovirus constructed using the flashBAC GOLD™ system was insufficient to improve the EV71 VLP yield. Nonetheless, BacF‐P1‐C3CD, a recombinant baculovirus constructed using the flashBAC GOLD(TM) system to express P1 under the polh promoter and 3CD under the CMV promoter, dramatically improved the VLP yield while alleviating the VLP degradation. Infection of High Five(TM) cells with BacF‐P1‐C3CD enhanced the total and extracellular VLP yield to ≈268 and ≈171 mg/L, respectively, which enabled the release of abundant VLP into the supernatant and simplified the downstream purification. Intramuscular immunization of mice with 5 μg purified VLP induced cross‐protective humoral responses and conferred protection against lethal virus challenge. Given the significantly improved extracellular VLP yield (≈171 mg/L) and the potent immunogenicity conferred by 5 μg VLP, one liter High Five(TM) culture produced ≈12,000 doses of purified vaccine, thus rendering the EV71 VLP vaccine economically viable and able to compete with inactivated virus vaccines.

This article investigates how Korea has to improve emergency managers' disciplinary approach to ultimately contribute to the goal of effective transnational disaster management. This study uses qualitative content analysis of government policies, college curricula, nongovernmental organizations' (NGOs') emergency-manager certification, and mass media coverage to compare emergency managers' unidisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches. The key tenet is that Korea must change its emergency managers' unidisciplinary approach into a multidisciplinary approach because the former is less effective when dealing with complicated disaster management systems. To achieve this change, the stakeholders must carry out their assigned responsibilities under risk-oriented management.

For this purpose, a magnetic device generating 7.5 T/m uniform magnetic field gradient was designed and incorporated to a commercial spectrophotometer. Different batches of colloidal superparamagnetic particles (SMPs), with different elemental compositions, were functionalized with twenty-mer complementary oligonucleotides, TB1 and TB2. When the functionalized SMPs-TB1 and SMPs-TB2 are mixed and incubated, the hybridization process of TB1 and TB2 occurs resulting in the formation of colloidal aggregates. When brought under the magnetic field, depending on the magnetic strength (Γ) of the formed aggregates, they separate either faster or slower than the non-functionalized SMPs. The difference in magnetic separation time (Δt) is optically monitored by measuring the real time transparency of the suspension at specific wavelengths. The detection of aggregates at concentrations of 0.001% w/v was achieved, showing [Formula: see text] ranging from 113−228 s.

No intervention has yet been proven effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Some randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of different drugs have been published, and more are currently underway. There is an urgent need for a living, dynamic systematic review that continuously evaluates the beneficial and harmful effects of all available interventions for COVID-19. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a living systematic review based on searches of major medical databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL) and clinical trial registries from their inception onwards to identify relevant randomized clinical trials. We will update the literature search once a week to continuously assess if new evidence is available. Two review authors will independently extract data and perform risk of bias assessment. We will include randomized clinical trials comparing any intervention for the treatment of COVID-19 (e.g., pharmacological interventions, fluid therapy, invasive or noninvasive ventilation, or similar interventions) with any comparator (e.g., an “active” comparator, standard care, placebo, no intervention, or “active placebo”) for participants in all age groups with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes will be admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and non-serious adverse events. The living systematic review will include aggregate data meta-analyses, Trial Sequential Analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Risk of bias will be assessed with domains, an eight-step procedure will be used to assess if the thresholds for clinical significance are crossed, and the certainty of the evidence will be assessed by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). DISCUSSION: COVID-19 has become a pandemic with substantial mortality. A living systematic review evaluating the beneficial and harmful effects of pharmacological and other interventions is urgently needed. This review will continuously inform best practice in treatment and clinical research of this highly prevalent disease.

Previous studies suggest that the PEDV E protein plays an important role in the viral assembly process. However, the subcellular localization and other functions of PEDV E protein still require more research. METHODS: The subcellular localization and function of PEDV E protein were investigated by examining its effects on cell growth, cell cycle progression, interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression and cell survival. RESULTS: The results show that plenty of PEDV E protein is localized in the ER, with small quantities localized in the nucleus. The PEDV E protein has no effect on the intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) growth, cell cycle and cyclin A expression. The cells expressing PEDV E protein express higher levels of IL-8 than control cells. Further studies show that PEDV E protein induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated NF-κB which is responsible for the up-regulation of IL-8 and Bcl-2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the PEDV E protein is localized in the ER and the nucleus and it can cause ER stress. The PEDV E protein had no effect on the IEC growth and cell cycle.

Twenty three calves from BCV-free herds were randomly divided into control and several treatment groups. All calves were orally challenged with 1 × 109 TCID50 of the virulent Kakegawa strain of BCV at 24 to 36 h after birth. Calves in treatment groups received either egg yolk powder or cow colostrum containing BCV specific antibodies. Daily treatment with these antibody preparations started 6 h until 7 days post-challenge. Control calves which received no antibody had severe diarrhea and all died within 6 days after infection. In contrast, calves fed milk containing egg yolk or colostrum with neutralization titers of 1:2560 or 1:10 240 respectively all survived and had positive weight gain unlike the other treatment groups. These results indicate that the orally administered egg yolk and colostrum powders protected against BCV-induced diarrhea in neonatal calves and that the egg yolk used provided a higher degree of protection compared to colostrum powder on a titer basis.

However, most microarray assays are labour‐intensive and time‐consuming to perform. This study describes the development and initial evaluation of a multiplex reverse transcription (RT)‐PCR and novel accompanying automated electronic microarray assay for simultaneous detection and differentiation of seven important viruses that affect swine (foot‐and‐mouth disease virus [FMDV], swine vesicular disease virus [SVDV], vesicular exanthema of swine virus [VESV], African swine fever virus [ASFV], classical swine fever virus [CSFV], porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus [PRRSV] and porcine circovirus type 2 [PCV2]). The novel electronic microarray assay utilizes a single, user‐friendly instrument that integrates and automates capture probe printing, hybridization, washing and reporting on a disposable electronic microarray cartridge with 400 features. This assay accurately detected and identified a total of 68 isolates of the seven targeted virus species including 23 samples of FMDV, representing all seven serotypes, and 10 CSFV strains, representing all three genotypes. The assay successfully detected viruses in clinical samples from the field, experimentally infected animals (as early as 1 day post‐infection (dpi) for FMDV and SVDV, 4 dpi for ASFV, 5 dpi for CSFV), as well as in biological material that were spiked with target viruses. The limit of detection was 10 copies/μl for ASFV, PCV2 and PRRSV, 100 copies/μl for SVDV, CSFV, VESV and 1,000 copies/μl for FMDV. The electronic microarray component had reduced analytical sensitivity for several of the target viruses when compared with the multiplex RT‐PCR. The integration of capture probe printing allows custom onsite array printing as needed, while electrophoretically driven hybridization generates results faster than conventional microarrays that rely on passive hybridization. With further refinement, this novel, rapid, highly automated microarray technology has potential applications in multipathogen surveillance of livestock diseases.",2017-11-30,"Erickson, A.; Fisher, M.; Furukawa‐Stoffer, T.; Ambagala, A.; Hodko, D.; Pasick, J.; King, D.

To verify the precise route of infection for the case, we conducted an in-depth epidemiological investigation in cooperation with the KCDC. METHODS: We reviewed the MERS outbreak investigation report of the KCDC, and interviewed the healthcare worker who had recovered from MERS. Using the media interview data, we reaffirmed and supplemented the nature of the exposure. RESULTS: The healthcare worker, a nurse, was infected while performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for a MERS patient in an isolation room. During the CPR which lasted for an hour, a large amount of body fluid was splashed. The nurse was presumed to have touched the mask to adjust its position during the CPR. She suggested that she was contaminated with the MERS patient’s body fluids by wiping away the sweat from her face during the CPR. CONCLUSIONS: The possible routes of infection may include the following: respiratory invasion of aerosols contaminated with MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) through a gap between the face and mask; mucosal exposure to sweat contaminated with MERS-CoV; and contamination during doffing of personal protective equipment.

Methods Between January 2018 and March 2020, 1027 NCPP and 1140 IP were recruited from Tongji hospital. Blood routine examination, biochemical indicators, and coagulation function analysis were performed in all participants simultaneously. Results There was no sex predominance in NCPP. The NCPP were frequently encountered in the sixth and seventh decades of life. The mean age of NCPP (56±16 years) was higher than IP (47±17 years), but without statistical difference. Although most results of routine laboratory tests between NCPP and IP had no significant difference, some laboratory tests showed an obvious change in NCPP. We observed that NCPP had significantly decreased white blood cells, alkaline phosphatase, and d-dimer, compared with IP. However, the results of lactate dehydrogenase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fibrinogen were significantly increased in NCPP compared with those in IP. The diagnostic model based on combination of eighteen routine laboratory indicators showed an area under the curve of 0.796 (95% CI, 0.777 to 0.814), with a sensitivity of 46.93% and a specificity of 90.09% when using a cutoff value of 0.598.

Bronchiolitis is the most common acute respiratory infection in children under 1 year of age, and the most common cause of hospitalization in this age group. RSV accounts for approximately 70% of all these cases, followed by rhinovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus and bocavirus. The association between bronchiolitis caused by RSV and the development of recurrent wheezing and/or asthma was first described more than 40 years ago, but it is still unclear whether bronchiolitis causes chronic respiratory symptoms, or if it is a marker for children with a genetic predisposition for developing asthma in the medium or long term. In any case, sufficient evidence is available to corroborate the existence of this association, which is particularly strong when the causative agent of bronchiolitis is rhinovirus. The pathogenic role of respiratory viruses as triggers for exacerbations in asthmatic patients has not been fully characterized. However, it is clear that respiratory viruses, and in particular rhinovirus, are the most common causes of exacerbation in children, and some type of respiratory virus has been identified in over 90% of children hospitalized for an episode of wheezing.

Since pathology in such diseases is often attributed to an over-active inflammatory response, we tested the hypothesis that bat cells respond to stimulation of their receptors for viral ligands with a strong antiviral response, but unlike in human cells, the inflammatory response is not overtly activated. We compared the response of human and bat cells to poly(I:C), a viral double-stranded RNA surrogate. We measured transcripts for several inflammatory, interferon and interferon stimulated genes using quantitative real-time PCR and observed that human and bat cells both, when stimulated with poly(I:C), contained higher levels of transcripts for interferon beta than unstimulated cells. In contrast, only human cells expressed robust amount of RNA for TNFα, a cell signaling protein involved in systemic inflammation.

The emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections in the spring of 2009 quickly led to a worldwide pandemic in humans, with subsequent introduction of the virus to pig populations. Following a widespread infection in the human population in Norway, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was introduced to the influenza A naïve Norwegian pig population, and within a few months pigs in more than one third of Norwegian swine herds had antibodies against the virus. A cross-sectional study was performed on all swine nucleus and multiplier herds in Norway to analyze risk factors for introduction of infection, and the preventive effects of recommended biosecurity practices. A surveillance program provided information on infection status of the study herds, and a questionnaire was administered to all 118 nucleus and multiplier herds to collect information on herd variables. The surveillance program revealed that pigs in 42% of the herds had antibodies against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The incidence of serologically positive pigs was similar in both multiplier herds (41%) and closed nucleus herds (43%). Multivariable logistic regression showed that presence of farm staff with influenza-like illness (ILI) (OR = 4.15, CI 1.5–11.4, p = 0.005) and herd size (OR = 1.01, CI 1–1.02, p = 0.009) were risk factors for infection.

The detection limit of dual UNDP-PCR for single or multiple infections of PEDV and TGEV is 25 copies/g, which is 400 times more sensitive than the currently known duplex RT-PCR, showing better specificity and sensitivity without cross-reaction with other viruses. For pre-clinical fecal samples, the dual UNDP-PCR showed a markedly higher positive detection rate (52.08%) than conventional duplex RT-PCR (13.21%), can rapidly and accurately identify targeted pathogens whenever simple virus infection or co-infection.

The difference in testing makes it difficult to compare the effect of different containment strategies. We propose methods to allow a direct comparison and we present the results of this comparison. DESIGN: Publicly available data on numbers of reported COVID-19 related deaths between January 1(st) and April 17(th) 2020 were compared between countries. RESULTS: The numbers of cases or deaths per 100,000 inhabitants give severely biased comparisons between countries. Only the number of deaths expressed as a percentage of the number of deaths on day 25 after the first reported COVID-19 related death allows a direct comparison between countries. From this comparison we observed clear differences between countries, associated with the timing of the implementation of containment measures. CONCLUSIONS: Comparisons between countries are only possible when simultaneously taking into account that the virus did not arrive in all countries simultaneously, absolute numbers are incomparable due to different population sizes, rates per 100,000 of the population are incomparable because not all countries are affected homogeneously, susceptibility to death by COVID-19 can differ between populations, and a death will only be reported as a COVID-19 related death if the patient was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. With our methods, we accounted for all these factors and established an unbiased direct comparison between countries.

Effective mucosal immunity by vaccination should provide protection at this primary infection site. Our aim was to develop a new vaccination strategy that elicits a mucosal immune response. A new strain of Enterococcus faecium, a non pathogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with strong cell adhesion ability, was identified and used as a vaccine vector to deliver two model antigens. Specifically, sigma (σ) C protein of avian reovirus (ARV), a functional homolog of mammalian reovirus σ1 protein and responsible for M-cell targeting, was administered together with a subfragment of the spike protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Next, the effect of immunization route on the immune response was assessed by delivering the antigens via the LAB strain. Intranasal (IN) immunization induced stronger humoral responses than intragastic (IG) immunization. IN immunization produced antigen specific IgA both systemically and in the lungs. A higher IgA titer was induced by the LAB with ARV σC protein attached. Moreover, the serum of mice immunized with LAB displaying divalent antigens had much stronger immune reactivity against ARV σC protein compared to IBV-S1. Our results indicate that ARV σC protein delivered by LAB via the IN route elicits strong mucosal immunity. A needle-free delivery approach is a convenient and cost effective method of vaccine administration, especially for respiratory infections in economic animals.

With the exception of Dengue fever, LASV has the highest human impact of any haemorrhagic fever virus. On-going outbreaks in Nigeria have resulted in unprecedented mortality. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has listed LASV as a high priority pathogen for the development of treatments and prophylactics. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines to protect against LASV infection. Although numerous candidates have demonstrated efficacy in animal models, to date, only a single candidate has advanced to clinical trials. Lassa fever vaccine development efforts have been hindered by the high cost of biocontainment requirements, the absence of established correlates of protection, and uncertainty regarding the extent to which animal models are predictive of vaccine efficacy in humans.

Therefore, we sought to determine the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, outcomes, and severity of illnesses associated with HCoV infections at a single center in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with positive HCoV respiratory specimens between October 2014 and December 2014 who were admitted to Severance Children’s Hospital at Yonsei University Medical Center for LRTI. Charts of the patients with HCoV infection were reviewed and compared with RSV infection. RESULTS: During the study period, HCoV was the third most common respiratory virus and accounted for 13.7% of infections. Coinfection was detected in 43.8% of children with HCoV. Interestingly, one patient had both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63. Mild pneumonia was most common (60.4%) with HCoV, and when combined with RSV, resulted in bronchiolitis. Two patients required care in the intensive care unit. However, compared with that of RSV infection, the disease course HCoV was short.

While it is still too early to determine why the gender gap is emerging, this article point to several possible factors such as higher expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE 2; receptors for coronavirus) in male than female, sex-based immunological differences driven by sex hormone and X chromosome. Furthermore, a large part of this difference in number of deaths is caused by gender behavior (lifestyle), i.e., higher levels of smoking and drinking among men compared to women.

The disease spread globally, leading to the World Health Organization declaring it a pandemic in March 2020. The condition is often fatal in its severe form. As it is a previously unknown virus, no treatment is identified or any vaccine available. The burden of disease control and containment, therefore, falls upon a robust and geographically appropriate testing strategy. Testing policies are modified, in turn, by the rapidly evolving patterns of the disease in various nations and by the evolving nature of tests in development. It is, therefore, helpful to study different national models to learn from the experience of different countries. This article compares testing strategies in the UK and India as the two countries travel different paths in controlling the pandemic. The UK is one of the most severely affected countries in the world. Initially restricted to hospitalised patients, the UK has broadened the scope of testing to many categories of individuals. In contrast, India appears to have a lower prevalence of the infection. However, the large Indian population and relatively insufficient testing capacities so far have led India to adopt a different testing trajectory, with the testing currently focused on high-risk groups in the community and hospitals.

Each puppy was weighed once a week during the study period. The fecal score regarded as pathological was the highest score associated with a significant reduction in average daily gain (ADG). Fecal samples were checked by semi-quantitative PCR or RT-PCR for canine parvovirus type 2 and canine coronavirus identification, respectively. The quality of feces was affected by both age and breed size. In small breeds, the ADG was significantly reduced under a fecal score of 6 and 7 for puppies at 4–5 and 6–8 weeks of age, respectively. In large breeds, the ADG was significantly reduced under a fecal score of 5 whatever the age of the puppy. Whereas a high viral load of canine parvovirus type 2 significantly impacted feces quality, no effect was recorded for canine coronavirus. This study provides an objective threshold for evaluation of fecal quality in weaning puppies. It also emphasizes the importance to be given to age and breed size in that evaluation.",2012-10-01,"Grellet, Aurélien; Feugier, Alexandre; Chastant-Maillard, Sylvie; Carrez, Bruno; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Casseleux, Gregory; Grandjean, Dominique",Prev Vet Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a05d13a1bdfe9e0f2bb00adad0ad7d0cd515bae4.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114323.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2012.03.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587712001109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22520179/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587712001109,34741415

Very recently, we have demonstrated the indispensability of ORF1 protease-domain cysteines and histidines in HEV replication, ex vivo (Parvez, 2013). In this report, the polyprotein partial sequences of HEV strains and genetically-related RNA viruses were analyzed, in silico. Employing the consensus-prediction results of RUBV-p(150) protease as structural-template, a 3D model of HEV-protease was deduced. Similar to RUBV-p(150), a ‘papain-like β-barrel fold’ structurally confirmed the classification of HEV-protease. Further, we recognized a catalytic ‘Cys434-His443’ dyad homologue of RUBV-p(150) (Cys1152-His1273) and FMDV-L(pro) (Cys51-His148) in line with our previous mutational analysis that showed essentiality of ‘His443’ but not ‘His590’ in HEV viability. Moreover, a RUBV ‘Zn(2+) binding motif’ (Cys1167-Cys1175-Cys1178-Cys1225-Cys1227) equivalent of HEV was identified as ‘Cys457-His458-Cys459 and Cys481-Cys483’ residues within the ‘β-barrel fold’. Notably, unlike RUBV, ‘His458’ also clustered therein, that was in conformity with the consensus cysteine protease ‘Zn(2+)-binding motif’. By homology, we also proposed an overlapping ‘Ca(2+)-binding site’ ‘D-X-[DNS]-[ILVFYW]-[DEN]-G-[GP]-XX-DE’ signature, and a ‘proline-rich motif’ interacting ‘tryptophan (W437-W472)’ module in the modeled structure. Our analysis of the predicted model therefore, warrants critical roles of the ‘catalytic dyad’ and ‘divalent metal-binding motifs’ in HEV protease structural-integrity, ORF1 self-processing, and RNA replication. This however, needs further experimental validations.",2014-01-22,"Parvez, Mohammad Khalid; Khan, Azmat Ali",Virus Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3b5c406e95bdc2cd2dd35261b0737152cb7534c6.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114377.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24321124/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170213004231; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170213004231; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.11.016,41275954

The goal of this study was to assess the diagnostic values of different methods of detecting and estimating the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and the auxiliary diagnostic potential of antibody assays. By retrospectively analyzing the data of viral RNAs and serum IgM‐IgG antibodies against SARS‐CoV‐2 from 38 cases with confirmed COVID‐19 in the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang, we found that, in the early phase of the illness, the viral RNA was most abundant in the sputum specimens, followed by that in the throat swabs, while the antibody assays identified fewer positive cases at this stage. However, the sensitivity of the antibody assays overtook that of RNA test from eighth day of disease onset. Simultaneous use of antibody assay and RT‐qPCR improved the sensitivity of the diagnoses. Moreover, we found that most of these cases with no detectable viral RNA load during the early stages were able to be seropositive after 7 days. Our findings indicate that the antibody detection could be used as an effective supplementary indicator of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in suspected cases with no detectable viral RNA, and in conjunction with nucleic acid detection in confirming the infection.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the epidemiology characteristics of respiratory viruses found in children and adults with RTI from July 2009 to June 2012 in southern China. Methods In this work, a total of 14 237 nasopharyngeal swabs (14 237 patients from 25 hospitals) were analyzed, and seven respiratory viruses (influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus, human bocavirus) were detected using PCR/RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Results The demographic characteristics, viral prevalence, age distribution, seasonal distribution, and pathogen spectrum of the patients with RTIs were analyzed. Co-infection was observed in 483 specimens, but it was more common in male patients, inpatients, children, and young adults. It varied by season, being more prevalent in the spring and summer and less so in the winter. Human coronavirus and human bocavirus were the most common pathogens, tending to occur in co-infection with other respiratory viruses. Conclusions This work adds to our knowledge of the epidemiology characteristics of these seven common respiratory viruses among patients with RTI in southern China. The detection of the specific viral causes of infection provides a useful starting point for an understanding of illness attributable to respiratory infection, and might also provide data relevant to the development of prevention strategies.",2014-08-31,"Zhang, Dingmei; He, Zhenjian; Xu, Lin; Zhu, Xun; Wu, Jueheng; Wen, Weitao; Zheng, Yun; Deng, Yu; Chen, Jieling; Hu, Yiwen; Li, Mengfeng; Cao, Kaiyuan",International Journal of Infectious Diseases,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ec3aa6e4db639e10c2589f6d371e07d50bf9b6dd.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110535.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2014.02.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971214014581; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971214014581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24927663/,8832878

INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Control Group (Low-Dose LMWH): patients in this group will be administered Enoxaparin (Inhixa®) at standard prophylactic dose (i.e., 4000 UI subcutaneously once day). Intervention Group (High-Dose LMWH): patients in this group will be administered Enoxaparin (Inhixa®) at dose of 70 IU/kg every 12 hours, as reported in the following table. This dose is commonly used in Italy when a bridging strategy is required for the management of surgery or invasive procedures in patients taking anti-vitamin K oral anticoagulants The treatment with Enoxaparin will be initiated soon after randomization (maximum allowed starting time 12h after randomization). The treatment will be administered every 12 hours in the intervention group and every 24 hours in the control group. Treatments will be administered in the two arms until hospital discharge or the primary outcomes detailed below occur. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary Efficacy Endpoint: 1. Death. 2. Acute Myocardial Infarction [AMI]. 3. Objectively confirmed, symptomatic arterial or venous thromboembolism [TE]. 4. a. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (Cpap) or Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) or b. IMV in patients who at randomisation were in standard oxygen therapy by delivery interfaces. 5. Need for IMV, in patients who at randomisation were in Cpap or NIV. Time to the occurrence of each of these events will be recorded. Clinical worsening will be analysed as a binary outcome as well as a time-to-event one. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: : 1. Death. 2. Acute Myocardial Infarction [AMI]. 3.

MORTALITY AT 30 DAYS: Information about patients’ status will be sought in those who are discharged before 30 days on Day 30 from randomisation. Time to the occurrence of each of these events will be recorded. Each of these events will be analysed as a binary outcome and as a time-to-event one. Primary safety endpoint: Decrease in haemoglobin of 2 g/dl or more; Transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells; Bleeding that occurs in at least one of the following critical sites [intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular (within the corpus of the eye; thus, a conjunctival bleed is not an intraocular bleed), pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal]; Bleeding that is fatal (defined as a bleeding event that was the primary cause of death or contributed directly to death); Bleeding that necessitates surgical intervention. Time to the occurrence of each of these events will be recorded. Each of these events will be analysed as a binary outcome and as a time-to-event one. Secondary safety endpoint: 1. Any bleeding compromising hemodynamic. 2. Spontaneous hematoma larger than 25 cm2, or 100 cm2 if there was a traumatic cause. 3. Intramuscular hematoma documented by ultrasonography. 4. Epistaxis or gingival bleeding requiring tamponade or other medical intervention. 5. Bleeding from venipuncture for >5 minutes. 6. Haematuria that was macroscopic and was spontaneous or lasted for more than 24 hours after invasive procedures. 7. Haemoptysis, hematemesis or spontaneous rectal bleeding requiring endoscopy or other medical intervention. 8. Any other bleeding requiring temporary cessation of a study drug. Time to the occurrence of each of these events will be recorded. Each of these events will be analysed as a binary outcome and as a time-to-event one. RANDOMISATION: Randomisation (with a 1:1 randomisation ratio) will be centrally performed by using a secure, web-based system, which will be developed by the Methodological and Statistical Unit at the Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria of Modena. Randomisation stratified by 4 factors: 1) Gender (M/F); 2) Age (<75/≥75 years); 3) BMI (<30/≥30); 4) Comorbidities (0-1/>2) with random variable block sizes will be generated by STATA software. The web-based system will guarantee the allocation concealment. Blinding (masking) The study is conceived as open-label: patients and all health-care personnel involved in the study will be aware of the assigned group. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The target sample size is based on the hypothesis that LMWH administered at high doses versus low doses will significantly reduce the risk of clinical worsening. The overall sample size in this study is expected to be 300 with 150 in the Low-Dose LMWH control group and 150 in the High-Dose LMWH intervention group, recruited over 10-11 months. Assuming an alpha of 5% (two tailed) and a percentage of patients who experience clinical worsening in the control group being between 25% and 30%, the study will have 80% power to detect at least 50% relative reduction in the risk of death between low and high doses of heparin.

Vaccines based on passages 155–165 in cell cultures are available commercially as vaccines for the prevention and control of infections with TGEV in China. Nucleoprotein (N) sequences of the virus at passages 155 and 165 were aligned and compared using a computer software program. The suitability of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis for differentiation of the vaccine strain from the other TGEVs was investigated. The RFLP analysis identified a change in the cleavage sites of AclI at passages 155 and 165. This RFLP pattern of the N gene differentiated the Chinese vaccine strain from its parental strain, the 11 TGEVs studied and the other reported TGEVs in the GenBank. Using phylogenetic analysis, the Chinese TGEVs were divided into three groups (G1, G2, and G3).

Although Ghana did not record (and is yet to) any case, and several health workers have received numerous training schemes, there is no record of any study that assessed preparedness of healthcare workers (HCWS) regarding EVD and any emergency prone disease in Ghana. We therefore conducted a hospital based cross sectional study involving 101 HCWs from two facilities in Kumasi, Ghana to assess the level of preparedness of HCWs to respond to any possible EVD. METHODS: We administered a face-to-face questionnaire using an adapted WHO (2015) and CDC (2014) Checklist for Ebola Preparedness and assessed overall knowledge gaps, and preparedness of the Ghanaian HCWs in selected health facilities of the Ashanti Region of Ghana from October to December 2015. RESULTS: A total 92 (91.09%) HCWs indicated they were not adequately trained to handle an EVD suspected case. Only 25.74% (n = 26) considered their facilities sufficiently equipped to handle and manage EVD patients. When asked which disinfectant to use after attending to and caring for a suspected patient with EVD, only 8.91% (n = 9) could correctly identify the right disinfectant (χ(2) = 28.52, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates poor knowledge and ill preparedness and unwillingness of many HCWs to attend to EVD. Beyond knowledge acquisition, there is the need for more training from time to time to fully prepare HCWs to handle any possible EVD case.",2017-06-06,"Annan, Augustina Angelina; Yar, Denis Dekugmen; Owusu, Michael; Biney, Eno Akua; Forson, Paa Kobina; Okyere, Portia Boakye; Gyimah, Akosua Adumea; Owusu-Dabo, Ellis",BMC Public Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f8efe7295a7cf875c8a695df3e87a42e651ce60d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5461762.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-017-4474-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28587602/,6946715

We examined the epidemiologic and clinical factors associated with death for all laboratory-confirmed SARS patients in Taiwan. Methods Using initial data in medical records reported by hospitals to the Center for Disease Control in Taiwan, we analyzed whether hematological, biochemical and arterial blood gas measures could predict fatality in 346 SARS patients. Results Both fatalities (n = 73; 21.1%) and survivors had elevated plasma concentration of initial C-reactive protein (CRP), but the mean CRP concentration was higher in fatalities (47.7 ± 43.3 mg/L) than in survivors (24.6 ± 28.2 mg/L). Initial lymphocyte counts were low in both fatalities (814 ± 378/μL) and survivors (1019 ± 480/μL). After controlling for age and sex, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that hematological factors significantly associated with fatality included initial neutrophil count > 7000/μL (odds ratio [OR] = 6.4), initial CRP concentration > 47.5 mg/L (OR = 5.8) and lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) > 593.5 IU/L (OR = 4.2). Factors significantly associated with initial CRP concentration > 47.5 mg/L included dyspnea (OR = 4.3), red blood cell count < 4.1 × 106/μL (OR = 4.3) and serum aspartate amino-transferase > 57 IU/L (OR = 3.1).

Exposure to this powerful oxidizing agent can cause or exacerbate many lung conditions, especially those involving innate immunity. Surfactant protein-A (SP-A) plays many roles in innate immunity by participating directly in host defense as it exerts opsonin function, or indirectly via its ability to regulate alveolar macrophages and other innate immune cells. The mechanism(s) responsible for ozone-induced pathophysiology, while likely related to oxidative stress, are not well understood. METHODS: We employed 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), a discovery proteomics approach, coupled with MALDI-ToF/ToF to compare the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) proteomes in wild type (WT) and SP-A knockout (KO) mice and to assess the impact of ozone or filtered air on the expression of BAL proteins. Using the PANTHER database and the published literature most identified proteins were placed into three functional groups. RESULTS: We identified 66 proteins and focused our analysis on these proteins. Many of them fell into three categories: defense and immunity; redox regulation; and protein metabolism, modification and chaperones. In response to the oxidative stress of acute ozone exposure (2 ppm; 3 hours) there were many significant changes in levels of expression of proteins in these groups. Most of the proteins in the redox group were decreased, the proteins involved in protein metabolism increased, and roughly equal numbers of increases and decreases were seen in the defense and immunity group. Responses between WT and KO mice were similar in many respects. However, the percent change was consistently greater in the KO mice and there were more changes that achieved statistical significance in the KO mice, with levels of expression in filtered air-exposed KO mice being closer to ozone-exposed WT mice than to filtered air-exposed WT mice. CONCLUSION: We postulate that SP-A plays a role in reactive oxidant scavenging in WT mice and that its absence in the KO mice in the presence or absence of ozone exposure results in more pronounced, and presumably chronic, oxidative stress.",2009-03-26,"Haque, Rizwanul; Umstead, Todd M; Freeman, Willard M; Floros, Joanna; Phelps, David S",Proteome Sci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/844b876f1636f5d031fe856cd7a63ae5f5c11fe7.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2666657.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-5956-7-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19323824/,7207934

Although development of novel vaccines can prevent the SARS CoV-2 infections, it is still impeded by several other factors and therefore novel approaches towards treatment and management of this disease is the urgent need. Passive immunotherapy plays a vital role as a possible alternative to meet this challenge and among various antibody sources, chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) can be used as an alternative to mammalian antibodies which have been previously studied against SARS CoV outbreak in China. In this review, we discuss the strategies for the use of chicken egg yolk (IgY) antibodies in the development of rapid diagnosis and immunotherapy against SARS CoV-2. Also, IgY antibodies have previously been used against various respiratory bacterial and viral infections in humans and animals. Compared to mammalian antibodies (IgG), chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) have greater binding affinity to specific antigens, ease of extraction and lower production costs, hence possessing remarkable pathogen-neutralizing activity of pathogens in respiratory and lungs.

In acute viral infections, the infection of oligodendroglial cells, leading to cell destruction, may be the main mechanism for inducing this neuropathological lesion. In the case of a persistent virus infection in oligodendroglia cells, however, it is conceivable that functional impairment of oligodendroglia cells, or the induction of an immune reaction to the agent that may cross-react with brain antigens, could eventually cause demyelination. Therefore, pathogenic studies on subacute or chronic demyelinating encephalomyelitides in association with viral infections may provide information on the mechanisms involved in demyelination. In rats, depending on the biological property of the virus material used, the genetic background and immune response of the host, a subacute or late demyelinating encephalomyelitis can be induced, accompanied by primary demyelination.

In this study, we conducted serial nucleotide truncation, ranging from 1 to 190 nucleotides, to the 5′ UTR of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infectious full-length cDNA clone pAPRRS. In vitro synthetic RNAs were transfected into MARC-145 cells for further genetic and virologic analysis. Our results demonstrated that the first three nucleotides of PRRSV 5′ UTR were dispensable for virus viability, which however was repaired with foreign sequences. In order to assess if the primary sequence or structural element play more important regulatory roles, the CMV promoter-driven 5′ UTR truncation mutant cDNA clones were directly transfected into the BHK-21 cell lines. We found that PRRSV tolerated the first 16 nucleotides sequence alteration of 5′ UTR without losing virus viability. However, these revertant viruses contained a range of non-templated with unknown origin exogenous nucleotides in the repaired 5′ end. Further analyses revealed that the 5′ proximal stem–loop 1 (SL1) in the highly structured 5′ UTR was invariably required for virus infectivity.

Here, we report on the identification of a putative self-binding β-zipper-forming peptide within the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus spike (S) protein and its application in viral detection. Peptide array scanning of overlapping peptides covering the entire length of S protein identified 34 putative self-binding peptides of six clusters, five of which contained octapeptide core consensus sequences. The Cluster I consensus octapeptide sequence GINITNFR was predicted by the Eisenberg’s 3D profile method to have high amyloid-like fibrillation potential through steric β-zipper formation. Peptide C6 containing the Cluster I consensus sequence was shown to oligomerize and form amyloid-like fibrils. Taking advantage of this, C6 was further applied to detect the S protein expression in vitro by fluorescence staining. Meanwhile, the coiled-coil-forming Leu/Ile heptad repeat sequences within the S protein were under-represented during peptide array scanning, in agreement with that long peptide lengths were required to attain high helix-mediated interaction avidity.

As decision makers are considering the recommendations they should evaluate how to provide the most efficient protection strategies with minimum costs. The aim of this review is to identify and evaluate the existing economic evaluation literature in this area and to offer advice on how future evaluations on this topic should be conducted. METHODS: We searched the Scopus database for all literature on economic evaluation of mask or respirator use to control respiratory infection transmission. Reference lists from the identified studies were also manually searched. Seven studies met our inclusion criteria from the initial 806 studies identified by the search strategy and our manual search. RESULTS: Five studies considered interventions for seasonal and/or pandemic influenza, with one also considering SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). The other two studies focussed on tuberculosis transmission control interventions. The settings and methodologies of the studies varied greatly. No low-middle income settings were identified. Only one of the reviewed studies cited clinical evidence to inform their mask/respirator intervention effectiveness parameters. Mask and respirator interventions were generally reported by the study authors to be cost saving or cost-effective when compared to no intervention or other control measures, however the evaluations had important limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Given the large cost differential between masks and respirators, there is a need for more comprehensive economic evaluations to compare the relative costs and benefits of these interventions in situations and settings where alternative options are potentially applicable. There are at present insufficient well conducted cost-effectiveness studies to inform decision-makers on the value for money of alternative mask/respirator options.",2015-10-13,"Mukerji, Shohini; MacIntyre, C.

It takes empirical data from an on-site survey of 108 operating plants in Maharashtra to formulate objectives and decision-making metrics for the agent-based model and simulates possible future portfolio mixes. The studied decision drivers were capital costs, operating costs (including fuel consumption), a combination of capital and operating costs, and net present value. Where investors used a weighted combination of capital cost and operating costs, a natural gas uptake of ~12PJ was obtained and the highest cumulative emissions reduction was obtained, 2 Mt CO(2) in the period from 2020 to 2050. Conversely if net present value alone is used, cumulative emissions reduction in the same period was lower, 1.6 Mt CO(2), and the cumulative uptake of natural gas was equal to 15PJ. Results show how the differing upfront investment cost of the technology options could cause prevalence of high-carbon fuels, particularly heavy fuel oil, in the final mix. Results also represent the unique heterogeneity of fuel-switching industrial investors with distinct investment goals and limited foresight on costs. The perception of high capital expenditures for decarbonisation represents a significant barrier to the energy transition in industry and should be addressed via effective policy making (e.g. carbon policy/price).",2020-09-15,"Moya, Diego; Budinis, Sara; Giarola, Sara; Hawkes, Adam",Appl Energy,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/1f115df733a6cc13fbd85c799d7c3bd0b23a1b46.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7282776.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32536741/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115295; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261920308072; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306261920308072,219547852

METHODS: This is a mixed method exploratory survey. A questionnaire exploring expectations of doctors from administration and seniors as well as their fears while working during pandemic, was developed on Google survey Forms. It included eight closed ended questions and four open ended questions. Data was collected through online Google survey Forms during month of March and April 2020. Doctors were approached through email and WhatsApp group. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 33.58±4.21 years. Female 150(67.5%) and Male 72(32.4%) participated. 29(13.1%) Associate Professor, 34(15.3%) Assistant Professor, 56(25.2%) Senior Residents and 103(46.3%) residents, medical officers and house officers responded to the survey. 134(60.3%) doctors were working in hospitals which were not dealing with Covid-19.

While the effect of hand washing on individual transmissibility of a disease has been studied through medical and public-health research, its potential as a mitigation strategy against a global pandemic has not been fully explored yet. In this study, we investigate contagion dynamics through the world air transportation network and analyze the impact of hand-hygiene behavioural changes of airport population against the spread of infectious diseases worldwide. Using a granular dataset of the world air transportation traffic, we build a detailed individual mobility model that controls for the correlated and recurrent nature of human travel and the waiting-time distributions of individuals at different locations. We perform a Monte-Carlo simulation study to assess the impact of different hand-washing mitigation strategies at the early stages of a global epidemic. From the simulation results we find that increasing the hand cleanliness homogeneously at all airports in the world can inhibit the impact of a potential pandemic by 24 to 69%. By quantifying and ranking the contribution of the different airports to the mitigation of an epidemic outbreak, we identify ten key airports at the core of a cost-optimal deployment of the hand-washing strategy: increasing the engagement rate at those locations alone could potentially reduce a world pandemic by 8 to 37%.

The reduction of this inflammatory immune-response could be considered as a potential therapeutic target against severe COVID-19. The relationship between inflammation and clot activation must also be considered. Furthermore, we must keep in mind that currently, no specific antiviral treatment is available for SARS-CoV-2.

In this study, we showed that a virulent TGEV SHXB strain could infect porcine immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs), and down-regulate cell surface markers (SLA-II-DR, CD1a and CD80/86). Moreover, SHXB-infected immature Mo-DCs showed low expression of IL-12 and IFN-γ, and also lost the ability to stimulate T cell proliferation. Finally, SHXB inhibited the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in these cells. Instead, UV-inactivated SHXB (UV-SHXB) had the opposite effects in immature Mo-DCs.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 30 COVID-19 patients, 24 influenza A (H1N1) patients, and 30 matched healthy controls (HC) to identify differences in the gut microbiota by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene V3-V4 region sequencing. RESULTS: Compared with HC, COVID-19 patients had significantly reduced bacterial diversity, a significantly higher relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus, Rothia, Veillonella and Actinomyces, and a lower relative abundance of beneficial symbionts. Five biomarkers showed high accuracy for distinguishing COVID-19 patients from HC with an area under the curve (AUC) up to 0.89. Patients with H1N1 displayed lower diversity and different overall microbial composition compared with COVID-19 patients. Seven biomarkers were selected to distinguish the two cohorts with an AUC of 0.94. CONCLUSION: The gut microbial signature of patients with COVID-19 was different from that of H1N1 patients and HC.

Domestic and mainly wild animals such as bats, small rodents and birds are highly diversified animals in relation to their habitats and ecological niches and are widely distributed geographically in environments of forest fragmentation in some areas of the Amazon, being considered important sources for viruses that affect humans and other animals. Due to the anthropical activities, these animals changed their natural habitat and adapted to urbanized environments, thus representing risks to human and animal health.

It was concluded that novel IBVs, which have not been detected since 1993, and which are phylogenically more distant from classical IBVs than turkey coronaviruses, might still be circulating and contributing to the evolution of IBV in Australia.",2010-06-24,"Mardani, Karim; Noormohammadi, Amir H.; Ignjatovic, Jagoda; Browning, Glenn F.",Arch Virol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4dabce1c1aa180f4b11c042ee5d82b59ace9c1a5.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086740.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-010-0731-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20574643/,31419275

In oncofertility, patients should receive their fertility preservation treatments urgently even in limited resource settings before initiation of anticancer therapy. Therefore, it is very crucial to learn more about oncofertility practice in limited resource settings such as in developing countries that suffer often from shortage of healthcare services provided to young patients with cancer. METHODS: As an extrapolation during the global crisis of COVID-19 pandemic, we surveyed oncofertility centers from 14 developing countries (Egypt, Tunisia, Brazil, Peru, Panama, Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, Argentina, Chile, Nigeria, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and India). Survey questionnaire included questions on the availability and degree of utilization of fertility preservation options in case of childhood cancer, breast cancer, and blood cancer. RESULTS: All surveyed centers responded to all questions. Responses and their calculated oncofertility scores showed different domestic standards for oncofertility practice in case of childhood cancer, breast cancer, and blood cancer in the developing countries under limited resource settings. CONCLUSIONS: Medical practice in limited resource settings has become a critical topic especially after the global crisis of COVID-19 pandemic.

Human serum containing specific antibodies against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) was immobilized on a silanized surface of an interdigitated sensor via protein A/glutaraldehyde for electrical detection of JEV antigens. The effective immobilization of serum antibodies on the sensor surface was verified by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and fluorescence microscopy. The signal of the biosensor obtained by the differential voltage converted from the change into non-Faradic impedance resulting from the specific binding of JEV antigens on the surface of the sensor. The detection analyzed indicates that the detection range of this biosensor is 1–10 μg/ml JEV antigens, with a detection limit of 0.75 μg/ml and that stable signals are measured in about 20 min.

Key findings Re-organization of radiographic manpower, patient segregation, and modification of routine radiographic practices are key measures to help radiographic services deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, emphasis on deploying more mobile radiographic units, segregating equipment, developing consistent image acquisition workflows, and strict adherence to infection control protocols are paramount to minimize the possibility of in-hospital transmission and ensure a safe environment for both patients and staff. Streamlining communication channels between leadership and ground staff allows quick dissemination of information to ultimately facilitate safe provision of services. Conclusion COVID-19 has drastically altered the way general radiography teams provide services. The institution of several key measures will allow hospitals to safely and sustainably provide radiographic services. To date, there have been zero incidences of radiographer healthcare worker transmission within our institution during the course of work.

Although the majority of patients present with fever, dyspnea, cough, or myalgia, various signs and symptoms have been reported for this disease. Recently, neurological symptoms have been noticed in patients with COVID-19 with unknown etiology. However, the occurrence of strokes in young and middle aged patients with COVID-19 is not fully explained. METHODS: In this series, six patients younger than 55 years of age with diagnosis of stroke and a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were evaluated for symptoms, lab data, imaging findings, and outcomes from March 2020 to the end of April 2020 from all stroke cases in a tertiary academic hospital. Patients older than 55 and all others who had evidence of cardiac abnormalities (arrhythmia/valvular) were excluded. RESULTS: Fever, myalgia, cough, and dyspnea were the most common clinical symptoms noted in 66.66% (4/6), 66.66% (4/6), 50% (3/6), and 50% (3/6) of the patients, respectively. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) for the patient was 10.16 ± 7.13 (ranged 5–24). The most involved area was middle cerebral artery (MCA) (five in MCA versus one in basal ganglia) and the majority of our patients had a low lung involvement score (mean ± SD: 13.16 ± 6.49 out of 24). Finally, one patient was deceased and rest discharged. CONCLUSION: Stroke may be unrelated to age and the extent of lung involvement.

In this study, between 2007 and 2014 fecal samples were collected from 97 dogs and 83 cats with diarrhea and examined to determine the prevalence of NoV and SaV infections in Japan. To detect caliciviruses, approximately 300 bases targeting the polymerase gene were amplified using RT‐PCR and subjected to phylogenetic and homology analyses. Specific PCR products were obtained from four canine and nine feline samples: two canine and one feline isolate were classified as NoV, two canine isolates as SaV and the remaining eight feline isolates as vesivirus (VeV). The three NoV isolates were classified into the same clade as that of known canine and feline NoVs; their homologies (75.9–92.3%) were higher than those with human genogroup IV (GIV) NoVs (59.1–65.9%). The homology of the feline NoV isolate with previously reported feline NoV isolates was particularly high (91.7–92.3%). Regarding SaV, the two canine isolates were classified into the same clade as known canine SaVs and their homologies (72.5–86.5%) were higher than those with other mammal SaVs (20.7–58.0%). The eight feline VeV isolates were assumed to be feline calicivirus. The present study is the first report of the presence of NoV‐ and SaV‐infected dogs and cats in Japan.

We found that a mutation at amino acid position 90 in the H5N1 HA, outside the receptor-binding domain (RBD), could simultaneously induce changes in the RBD conformation to escape from nAb binding and alter the receptor preference through long-range regulation. This mutation was deemed a “key event” for interspecies transmission. It is likely a result of positive selection caused by antibodies, allowing the original invasion by new species-specific variants. A mutation at amino acid position 160 in the RBD only induced a change in receptor preference. This mutation was deemed a “maintaining adaptation”, which ensured that influenza virus variants would be able to infect new organisms of a different species successfully. The mutation is the result of adaptation caused by the receptor. Our results suggest that continuing occurrence of these two types of mutations made the variants persist in the new host species.

In this paper, a geometric approach based on the Z-curve representation of the whole genome sequence is proposed to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of coronaviruses. The evolutionary distances are obtained through measuring the differences among the three-dimensional Z-curves. The Z-curve is approximately described by its geometric center and the associated three eigenvectors, which indicate the center position and the trend of the Z-curve, respectively. Although some information is lost due to the approximate description of the Z-curve, the phylogenetic tree constructed based on these parameters is consistent with those of previous analyses.

Moribund Muskellunge exhibited tubular necrosis in the kidneys as well as multifocal coalescing necrotizing hepatitis. The FHMNV was also isolated from apparently healthy juvenile Muskellunge at the Wolf Lake State Fish Hatchery in Mattawan, Michigan. The identity of the two syncytia‐forming viruses (designated MUS‐WR and MUS‐WL from Wild Rose Hatchery and Wolf Lake State Fish Hatchery, respectively) as strains of FHMNV was determined based on multiple‐gene sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. The pathogenicity of the MUS‐WL FHMNV strain was determined by experimentally infecting naive juvenile Muskellunge through intraperitoneal injection with two viral concentrations (63 and 6.3 × 10(3) TCID(50)/fish). Both doses resulted in 100% mortality in experimentally infected fish, which exhibited severely pale gills and petechial hemorrhaging in eyes, fins, and skin. Histopathological alterations in experimentally infected fish were observed mainly in the hematopoietic tissues in the form of focal areas of necrosis. Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated partial spike glycoprotein and helicase gene sequences revealed differences between the MUS‐WL FHMNV, MUS‐WR FHMNV, and two other FHMNV originally isolated from moribund Fathead Minnows Pimephales promelas including the index FHMNV strain (GU002364). Based on a partial helicase gene sequence, a reverse transcriptase PCR assay was developed that is specific to FHMNV.

Twenty-six-day-old weaned [PEDV-inoculated (n =11); mock (n =9)] and 9-day-old nursing pigs [PEDV-inoculated (n =9); mock (n =11)] were inoculated orally [8.9 log10 genomic equivalents (GE)/pig] with PC21A strain or mock (MEM). Pigs were monitored for clinical signs and PEDV RNA titers in feces and serum. For pathology and immunofluorescence staining for Ki67 (marker for crypt proliferation) and LGR5 (marker for crypt stem cell), 3–4 pigs were euthanized at postinoculation days (PIDs) 1, 3 and 5. Severe watery diarrhea and atrophic enteritis with moderate to high PEDV RNA titers in feces (7.5–12.2 log10 GE/ml) and low viral RNA titers in serum (5.6–8.6 log10 GE/ml) were observed in all inoculated nursing piglets at PIDs 1–5. In contrast, weaned pigs did not show evidence of PEDV infection at PID 1. Pigs exhibited high fecal shedding titers at PIDs 2–5 and mild to severe atrophic enteritis at PIDs 3–5, indicating a longer incubation for PEDV infection. While uninoculated or inoculated 27–31-day-old pigs showed large numbers of Ki67- or LGR5-positive cells in the intestinal crypts, there was a lack of LGR5-positive cells and low proliferation of crypts in jejunum of uninoculated 10–14-day-old piglets, possibly causing a slower turnover of enterocytes; however, the number of LGR5-positive cells and proliferation of intestinal crypts increased remarkably at 3–5 days after inoculation.

Understanding the cellular entry mechanisms of EBOV can promote the development of new therapeutic strategies to control virus replication and spread. It has been known that EBOV virions bind to factors expressed at the host cell surface. Subsequently, the virions are internalized by a macropinocytosis-like process, followed by being trafficked through early and late endosomes. Recent researches indicate that the entry of EBOV into cells requires integrated and functional lipid rafts. Whilst lipid rafts have been hypothesized to play a role in virus entry, there is a current lack of supporting data. One major technical hurdle is the lack of effective approaches for observing viral entry. To provide evidence on the involvement of lipid rafts in the entry process of EBOV, we generated the fluorescently labeled Ebola virus like particles (VLPs), and utilized single-particle tracking (SPT) to visualize the entry of fluorescent Ebola VLPs in live cells and the interaction of Ebola VLPs with lipid rafts.

Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) have not been unaware of this situation and due to their characteristics they are especially vulnerable. We present the results of the analysis of the COVID-19 Registry of the Spanish Society of Nephrology. Material and methods The Registry began operating on March 18th, 2020. It collects epidemiological variables, contagion and diagnosis data, signs and symptoms, treatments and outcomes. It is an “online” registry. Patients were diagnosed with SARS-Cov-2 infection based on the results of the PCR of the virus, carried out both in patients who had manifested compatible symptoms or had suspicious signs, as well as in those who had undergone screening after some contact. acquainted with another patient. Results As of April 11, the Registry had data on 868 patients, from all the Autonomous Communities. The most represented form of TRS is in-center hemodialysis (ICH) followed by transplant patients. Symptoms are similar to the general population. A very high percentage (85%) required hospital admission, 8% in intensive care units. The most used treatments were hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and steroids. Mortality is high and reaches 23%; deceased patients were more frequently on ICH, developed pneumonia more frequently, and received less frequently lopinavir-ritonavir and steroids. Age and pneumonia were independently associated with the risk of death. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection already affects a significant number of Spanish patients on RRT, mainly those on ICH, hospitalization rates are very high and mortality is high; age and the development of pneumonia are factors associated with mortality.",2020-04-27,"Sánchez-Álvarez, J.

Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R(0)), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R(0) as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be ∼4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be ∼3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R(0) was found to be ∼2.6 based on confirmed cases and ∼2 based on the second scenario. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with a lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones. Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around ∼0.15% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February.",2020-03-31,"Anastassopoulou, Cleo; Russo, Lucia; Tsakris, Athanasios; Siettos, Constantinos",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/77e305d16c96f220ddfe23abe6308b94c266bcbf.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108749.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32231374/,214749992

Objective We sought to examine the relation of the nasal microbiota at bronchiolitis-related hospitalization and 3 later points to the risk of recurrent wheezing by age 3 years. Methods In 17 US centers researchers collected clinical data and nasal swabs from infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis. Trained parents collected nasal swabs 3 weeks after hospitalization and, when healthy, during the summer and 1 year after hospitalization. We applied 16S rRNA gene sequencing to all nasal swabs. We used joint modeling to examine the relation of longitudinal nasal microbiota abundances to the risk of recurrent wheezing. Results Among 842 infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis, there was 88% follow-up at 3 years, and 31% had recurrent wheezing. The median age at enrollment was 3.2 months (interquartile range, 1.7-5.8 months). In joint modeling analyses adjusting for 16 covariates, including viral cause, a 10% increase in relative abundance of Moraxella or Streptococcus species 3 weeks after day 1 of hospitalization was associated with an increased risk of recurrent wheezing (hazard ratio [HR] of 1.38 and 95% high-density interval [HDI] of 1.11-1.85 and HR of 1.76 and 95% HDI of 1.13-3.19, respectively). Increased Streptococcus species abundance the summer after hospitalization was also associated with a greater risk of recurrent wheezing (HR, 1.76; 95% HDI, 1.15-3.27).

Numerous viruses have been shown to encode viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) to antagonize antiviral RNAi. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a medically important human pathogen that causes acute and chronic hepatitis. In this study, we screened all the nonstructural proteins of HCV and found that HCV NS2 could suppress RNAi induced either by small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in mammalian cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that NS2 could suppress RNAi via its direct interaction with double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) and siRNAs, and further identified that the cysteine 184 of NS2 is required for the RNAi suppression activity through a serial of point mutation analyses. Together, our findings uncovered that HCV NS2 can act as a VSR in vitro, thereby providing novel insights into the life cycle and virus-host interactions of HCV.

According to the current studies, numerous diseases including lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and immunosuppression appear to be at higher risk for severe forms of the COVID‐19. To date, there are no data in the literature on the comorbid dermatologic diseases and COVID‐19. We tried to analyze the previous dermatological comorbidity of 93 patients with COVID‐19 (51 males, 42 females) who presented to the dermatology outpatient clinics for the last 3 years. The most common dermatologic diseases in patients with COVID‐19 who have dermatologic diseases for the last three years were superficial fungal infections (24, 25.8%), seborrheic dermatitis (11, 11.8%), actinic keratosis (10, 10.8%), psoriasis (6, 6.5%) and eczema (6, 6.5%), respectively. In addition, the number of COVID‐19 patients who presented to dermatology in the last three months was 17 (11 men, 6 women).

There is a large number of viruses whose genome is RNA that allows some evolutionary advantages, such as rapid genome mutation. On the other hand, regions of the viral RNA genomes can adopt different structural conformations, some of them lacking functional relevance and acting as misfolded intermediates.

We demonstrate the successful application of this SFM in several microfluidic applications, such as the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) from chloroauric acid (HAuCl(4)), and nucleic acid amplification from the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) with a capillary convective polymerase chain reaction (ccPCR).",2014-12-01,"Hsieh, Yi-Fan; Yang, An-Shik; Chen, Jia-Wei; Liao, Shao-Kai; Su, Tsung-Wen; Yeh, Shiou-Hwei; Chen, Pei-Jer; Chen, Ping-Hei",Sens Actuators B Chem,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d089c40209491f561128d33d3536e87184b8ddbb.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126727.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925400514009629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288248/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2014.07.122; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400514009629,98647957

Approximately one-half of CNS infections remain of undetermined origin. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) brought new perspectives to CNS infection investigations, allowing investigation of viral aetiologies with an unbiased approach. HTS use is still limited to specific clinical situations. Objectives The aim of this review was to evaluate the contribution and pitfalls of HTS for the aetiologic identification of viral encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and meningitis in CNS patient samples. Sources PubMed was searched from 1 January 2008 to 2 August 2018 to retrieve available studies on the topic. Additional publications were included from a review of full-text sources. Content Among 366 studies retrieved, 29 used HTS as a diagnostic technique. HTS was performed in cerebrospinal fluid and brain biopsy samples of 307 patients, including immunocompromised, immunocompetent paediatric, and adult cases. HTS was performed retrospectively in 18 studies and prospectively in 11. HTS led to the identification of a potential causal virus in 41 patients, with 11 viruses known and ten not expected to cause CNS infections. Various HTS protocols were used. Implications The additional value of HTS is difficult to quantify because of various biases. Nevertheless, HTS led to the identification of a viral cause in 13% of encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and meningitis cases in which various assays failed to identify the cause. HTS should be considered early in clinical management as a complement to routine assays. Standardized strategies and systematic studies are needed for the integration of HTS in clinical management.",2019-04-30,"Zanella, M.-C.; Lenggenhager, L.; Schrenzel, J.; Cordey, S.; Kaiser, L.",Clinical Microbiology and Infection,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a671fa18adf73f23571f4f89ac7bd7aa7ddf9832.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129948.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30641229/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X18308127; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X18308127; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2018.12.022,58557033

In 2019, a multi-source analysis of complementary pharmacological data showed that using NSAIDs in these indications (potentially indicative of an underlying infection) increases the risk of a severe bacterial complication, in particular in the case of lung infections. First, the clinical observations of the French Pharmacovigilance Network showed that severe bacterial infections can occur even after a short NSAID treatment, and even if the NSAID is associated with an antibiotic. Second, pharmacoepidemiological studies, some of which minimized the protopathic bias, all converged and confirmed the risk. Third, experimental in vitro and in vivo animal studies suggest several biological mechanisms, which strengthens a causal link beyond the well-known risk of delaying the care of the infection (immunomodulatory effects, effects on Streptococcus pyogenes infections, and reduced antibiotics efficacy). Therefore, in case of infection, symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs for non-severe symptoms (fever, pain, or myalgia) is not to be recommended, given a range of clinical and scientific arguments supporting an increased risk of severe bacterial complication. Besides, the existence of a safer drug alternative, with paracetamol at recommended doses, makes this recommendation of precaution and common sense even more legitimate. In 2020, such recommendation is more topical than ever with the emergence of COVID-19, especially since it results in fever, headaches, muscular pain, and cough, and is further complicated with pneumopathy, and given experimental data suggesting a link between ibuprofen and the level of expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.",2020-05-07,"Micallef, Joëlle; Soeiro, Thomas; Annie-Pierre, Jonville‐Béra",Therapie,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a70941946d1a1e95e19d91856ce83fe4718d1b08.json,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040595720300925; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418728/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2020.05.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040595720300925?v=s5,218529844

Inicialmente se reportó que en los pacientes con progresión grave de la COVID-19 existía una mortalidad elevada, los cuales tenían antecedentes de sufrir de hipertensión arterial, diabetes mellitus, enfermedad cardiovascular y enfermedad renal crónica. Parte de estos pacientes también tenían en común que utilizaban IECA, lo cual alertó a la comunidad médica sobre su riesgo potencial en coexistencia con COVID-19. Sin embargo, estudios más recientes de casos-controles encontraron que los inhibidores del sistema renina-angiotensina, incluyendo los IECA, no incrementan el riesgo de COVID-19 o de requerir admisión hospitalaria por esta causa. Diferentes revistas científicas han facilitado el acceso a reportes preliminares, dejando a discreción de la comunidad médica y científica hacer uso de dicha información para promover el desarrollo de estudios que confirmen experimentalmente dichos hallazgos, preclínicos y epidemiológicos, que finalmente impacten en las decisiones de la práctica clínica para beneficiar a los pacientes con COVID-19.

Abstract There is limited evidence for determining the impact of the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) in the tendency to worsening of coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19). It was initially reported that, in patients with serious progression of COVID-19, there was an increased mortality in those that had a history of suffering arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. A proportion of these patients also had in common that they used ACE-I, which alerted the medical community on the potential risk in coexisting with COVID-19. However, in more recent case-control studies, they found that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, including ACE-I, does not increase the risk of COVID-19 or require hospital admission due to this cause. Several scientific journals have provided access to preliminary reports, leaving the use of such information at the discretion of the medical and scientific community for promoting the development of studies that might confirm these preclinical and epidemiological findings experimentally. These may finally have an impact on the clinical practice decisions, in order to benefit patients with COVID-19. In this literature review, the different effects mediated by ACE-I that could be related to the immune response during the infection and transmission of COVID-19 are examined, gathering available evidence that evaluates whether, in reality, they represent a risk or if on the other hand, they confer a protector effect.",2020-07-16,"Ardila, Dora Lucía Vallejo; Cáceres, Yenny Rocío Tamayo; Munive, Abraham Alí",Revista Colombiana de Cardiología,,#654853,,document_parses/pdf_json/89a6c58ef740c7f633a722e0fb2fe7eaafa38d69.json,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0120563320300942?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rccar.2020.07.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0120563320300942,220548217

Deconjugation of Ub or UBL from proteins is performed by a class of proteases called isopeptidases. Herein is described a readily quantifiable novel isopeptidase assay platform consisting of Ub or UBL fused to the reporter enzyme phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)). Isopeptidase activity releases PLA(2), which cleaves its substrate, generating a signal that is linear with deubiquitylase (DUB) concentration and is able to discriminate DUB, deSUMOylase, deNEDDylase, and deISGylase activities. The power and sensitivity of the UBL-PLA(2) assay are demonstrated by its ability to differentiate the contrasting deISGylase and DUB activities of two coronavirus proteases: severe acute respiratory syndrome papain-like protease (SARS-CoV PLpro) and NL63 CoV papain-like protease 2 (PLP2). Furthermore, direct comparisons with the current Ub-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ub-AMC) assay demonstrated that the Ub-PLA(2) assay is an effective tool for characterizing modulators of isopeptidase activity. This observation was expanded by profiling the inhibitory activity of the nonselective isopeptidase inhibitor NSC 632839 against DUBs and deSUMOylases.

Thus, we hypothesized that eRNA released from dying cells under AH activates TF via the TLR3-ERK1/2-AP1 pathway, leading to VT. Animals were exposed to stimulate hypoxia for 0–24 h at standard temperature and humidity. RNaseA and DNase1 were injected immediately before exposure. TLR3 gene silencing was performed through in vivo injection of TLR3 siRNA. 80 μg/kg BW of isolated eRNA and eDNA were injected 6 h prior to sacrifice.

AH exposure significantly induced release of SI markers i.e. eRNA, eDNA, HMGB1 and upregulated TLR3, ERK1/2 (Extracellular signal-regulated kinases), AP1 (Activator Protein-1) and TF, whereas RNaseA pre-treatment diminished the effect of AH, thus inhibiting TF expression as well as activity during AH.

Through modeling, we can estimate the half-life of infected cells, the exponential growth rate, and the basic reproduction number (R(0)). To calculate R(0) from virus load data, the death rate of productively infected cells is required. This can be readily estimated from treatment data collected during the chronic phase, but is difficult to determine from acute infection data. Here, we propose two new models that can reliably estimate the average life span of infected cells from acute-phase data, and apply both methods to experimental data from humanized mice infected with HIV-1. METHODS: Both new models, called as the reduced quasi-steady state (RQS) model and the piece-wise regression (PWR) model, are derived by simplification of a standard model for the acute-phase dynamics of target cells, viruses and infected cells. By having only a limited number of parameters, both models allow us to reliably estimate the death rate of productively infected cells. Simulated datasets with plausible parameter values are generated with the standard model to compare the performance of the new models with that of the major previous model (i.e., the simple exponential model). Finally, we fit models to time course data from HIV-1 infected humanized mice to estimate the several important parameters characterizing their acute infection. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The new models provided much better estimates than the previous model because they more precisely capture the de novo infection process.

RESULTS: IBV virus-like particles (VLPs) were generated through the co-infection with three recombinant baculoviruses separately encoding M, E or the recombinant S genes. The recombinant S protein was sufficiently flexible to retain the ability to self-assemble into VLPs. The size and morphology of the VLPs were similar to authentic IBV particles. In addition, the immunogenicity of IBV VLPs had been investigated. The results demonstrated that the efficiency of the newly generated VLPs was comparable to that of the inactivated M41 viruses in eliciting IBV-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in chickens via subcutaneous inoculation.

The response includes changes in the concentration of plasma proteins called acute phase proteins (APPs). Calf diarrhea is an important disease that occurs in association with the interaction of various infectious agents and calf susceptibility. The economic losses is associated with death loss and treatment costs, reduction of live weight gain, and reduction of productive life span, which may be considerable. The aim of the present study was to identify relationships among APPs in calves with diarrhea in the different clinical features. Holstein calves (50) within 1 day to 4 months old with signs of diarrhea and healthy calves (40) with similar age and sex were selected. Standard clinical examinations and also dehydration degree were carried out on each calf and were recorded. Calves with clinical signs of diarrhea were divided in different groups based on the severity of the clinical findings, fever and degree of dehydration. Blood samples were taken from the jugular vein from all calves into vacutainers containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for separating plasma and without EDTA for serum biochemical analysis. APP [haptoglobin (Hp), serum amyloid A (SAA), fibrinogen (Fib), and ceruloplasmin (Cp)] concentrations were measured using validated standard methods. The results indicated a significant increases in APPs in diarrheic calves which was most obvious in Hp and SAA (P < 0.001). Calves with severe clinical signs of diarrhea had a significant increases in their Hp and SAA (P < 0.001) compared to calves with moderate or without systemic clinical signs. Diarrheic calves with fever compared to diarrheic calves without fever had a significant increases in their Hp and SAA (P < 0.01). Also, diarrheic calves with severe dehydration compared to diarrheic calves with mild and moderate dehydration had significant increases in Hp and SAA (P < 0.05), and these parameters (Hp, SAA, Fib, and Cp) among calves with mild and moderate dehydration had no significant changes.

This includes inflammatory bowel disease, viral and non-viral associated intestinal lymphomas and immunodeficiency associated syndromes. Morphologic and phenotypic characterization of the normal small intestinal diffuse MALT in 22 SPF cats was performed using flow cytometry and cytology on isolated intestinal leukocytes from the intra-epithelial and lamina proprial compartments, as well as immunohistology on tissues from the feline duodenum, jejunum and ileum. The intra-epithelial compartment (IEC) was dominated by lymphocytes (>85%) which frequently contained intracytoplasmic granules. The most striking findings in the IEC were the elevated percentages of CD8α+ lymphocytes (40%), presumed to express CD8αα chains, and CD4−/CD8− (double negative) lymphocytes (44%), and the consistent presence of a minor subpopulation of CD3+/CD11d+ IELs (6%). Small percentages of CD4+ lymphocytes (10%) were observed such that the IEL CD4:CD8 ratio (0.25) was low. The LPC also contained a majority of T cells and few plasma cells. However, this compartment had reduced percentages of CD8α+ lymphocytes (28%) and increased percentages of CD4+ lymphocytes (27%) relative to the IEC. However, the LPL CD4:CD8 ratio (1.0) remained low compared with the ratio in peripheral blood. In feline MALT, MHC class II expression was lower than in other peripheral lymphoid compartments.

However, data from developing countries are rare and dynamic change of lymphocyte counts in severe pandemic influenza A/H1N1 is scarcely reported. This study aimed to observe change of lymphocyte counts in patients with severe pandemic influenza A/H1N1 and to investigate the correlation of lymphopenia and severe pandemic influenza A/H1N1. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the white blood cell counts and differentials and other clinical data in 21 hospitalized patients with severe pandemic influenza A/H1N1 confirmed by reverse-transcription PCR during 2009 and 2010. RESULTS: All patients, except two cases with bacterial co-infections, had normal or reduced white blood cell counts. Seventeen (81.0%) patients had decreased lymphocyte proportions (<20%) and counts (<0.8 × 10(9)/L), with the lowest value of 1.2% and 0.1 × 10(9)/L respectively. A patient with nosocomial infection of influenza A/H1N1 showed that lymphopenia occurred on the first day of illness. Lymphocyte proportions and absolute counts returned to normal or slightly higher than normal in 16 of the 17 patients within 2–3 weeks after the disease onset.

There is an increasing interest in the application of the photocatalytic properties of TiO(2) for disinfection of surfaces, air and water. Reviews of the applications of photocatalysis in disinfection (Gamage and Zhang 2010; Chong et al., Wat Res 44(10):2997–3027, 2010) and of modelling of TiO(2) action have recently been published (Dalrymple et al. , Appl Catal B 98(1–2):27–38, 2010). In this review, we give an overview of the effects of photoactivated TiO(2) on microorganisms. The activity has been shown to be capable of killing a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, filamentous and unicellular fungi, algae, protozoa, mammalian viruses and bacteriophage. Resting stages, particularly bacterial endospores, fungal spores and protozoan cysts, are generally more resistant than the vegetative forms, possibly due to the increased cell wall thickness. The killing mechanism involves degradation of the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane due to the production of reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide. This initially leads to leakage of cellular contents then cell lysis and may be followed by complete mineralisation of the organism. Killing is most efficient when there is close contact between the organisms and the TiO(2) catalyst. The killing activity is enhanced by the presence of other antimicrobial agents such as Cu and Ag.",2011-04-27,"Foster, Howard A.; Ditta, Iram B.; Varghese, Sajnu; Steele, Alex",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/bcf4bf26686826b048dd78057ca111c9c39754ed.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079867.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3213-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21523480/,21896875

A close association between migration and hibernation exists in temperate, but not in tropical, bats. Compared with birds, bats are relatively short-distance migrators, with maximum migration distances being <2000 km; intercontinental migration is likely to be uncommon in bats. Migratory bats have lower levels of population subdivision and larger genetically effective population sizes than nonmigratory bats. A variety of methods, including banding, genetic analyses, stable isotope analyses, and tracking with radio or satellite transmitters, are currently being used to study bat migration. The conservation of migratory bats poses special challenges that require national and international efforts. Migratory bats sometimes harbor pathogens that can be transmitted to humans. Overall, the beneficial aspects of migratory bats, including control of insect populations and dispersal of pollen and seeds over broad areas, far outweigh their negative aspects.",2019-12-31,"Fleming, Theodore H.",Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/33ea9c98c7d8c301024203604335c77ebae7b606.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149675.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128096338207644; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128096338207644,214758269

The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others. The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions.

A genome wide association study (GWAS) on this population suggested that resistance was polygenic but failed to identify any strong specific associations. In order to enhance the power of GWAS or whole genome sequencing to identify strong genetic associations, a decision was made to positively select for resistance over three generations. The inbreeding experiment began with a genetically related parental (P) population consisting of three toms and four queens identified from among the survivors of the earlier study and belonging to a closely related subgroup (B). The subsequent effects of inbreeding were measured using 42 genome-wide STR markers. P generation cats produced 57 first filial (F1) kittens, only five of which (9.0%) demonstrated a natural resistance to FIPV infection. One of these five F1 survivors was then used to produce six F1/P-backcrosses kittens, only one of which proved resistant to FIP. Six of eight of the F1 and F1/P survivors succumbed to a secondary exposure 4–12 months later. Therefore, survival after both primary and secondary infection was decreased rather than increased by positive selection for resistance.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess current global practice and experience in management of COVID‐19 associated coagulopathy to identify information to guide prospective and randomized studies. METHODS: Physicians were queried about their current approach to prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in patients with COVID‐19 using an online survey tool distributed through multiple international organizations between April 10 and 14, 2020. RESULTS: 515 physicians responded from 41 countries. The majority of respondents (78%) recommended prophylactic anticoagulation for all hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 with most recommending use of low‐molecular‐weight heparin or unfractionated heparin. Significant practice variation was found regarding need for dose escalation of anticoagulation outside the setting of confirmed or suspected VTE. Respondents reported the use of bedside testing when unable to perform standard diagnostic imaging for diagnosis of VTE. 291 respondents reported observing thrombotic complications in their patients with 64% noting that the complication was pulmonary embolism (PE).

The capsid protein open reading frame 2 (ORF2) is known to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress in ORF2 expressing cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we found that HEV ORF2 activates the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). ORF2 stimulates the CHOP promoter mainly through AARE (amino acid response elements) and to a minor extent the ERSE (endoplasmic reticulum stress response elements). Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) protein binds and activates the AARE regulatory sites of the CHOP promoter. ORF2 expression also leads to increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) that in turn initiates the translation of ATF4 mRNA. The pro-apoptotic gene CHOP is an important trigger to initiate endoplasmic reticulum stress induced apoptosis. However, the activation of CHOP by ORF2 in this study did not induce apoptosis, nor did BCL2-associated X protein (Bax) translocate to mitochondria. Microarray analysis revealed an ORF2 specific increased expression of chaperones Hsp72, Hsp70B', and co-chaperone Hsp40. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and in silico molecular docking analysis suggests that HEV ORF2 interacts with Hsp72. In addition, Hsp72 shows nuclear accumulation in ORF2 expressing cells.

During the past few years, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods have been developed for many pathogens causing respiratory tract infections. The aim of this study was to determine the etiology of CAP among adults—especially the occurrence of mixed infections among patients with CAP—by implementing a new diagnostic PCR platform combined with conventional methods. METHODS: Adults admitted to Karolinska University Hospital were studied prospectively during a 12-month period. Microbiological testing methods included culture from blood, sputum, and nasopharyngeal secretion samples; sputum samples analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis; nasopharyngeal specimens analyzed by use of PCR; serological testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and viruses common in the respiratory tract; and urine antigen assays for detection of pneumococcal and Legionella pneumophila antigens. RESULTS: A microbial etiology could be identified for 67% of the patients (n = 124). For patients with complete sampling, a microbiological agent was identified for 89% of the cases. The most frequently detected pathogens were S. pneumoniae (70 patients [38]) and respiratory virus (53 patients [29]). Two or more pathogens were present in 43 (35%) of 124 cases with a determined etiology. CONCLUSIONS: By supplementing traditional diagnostic methods with new PCR-based methods, a high microbial yield was achieved. This was especially evident for patients with complete sampling.

This intersection of disciplines, however, has a rich history and is currently revitalized by newfound functions of the microbiome and the gut-brain axis in human diseases. Schizophrenia, in particular, fits this model as a disorder with gene and environmental roots that may be anchored in the immune system. In this context, the combination of a precisely timed pathogen exposure in a person with genetically encoded altered immunity may have especially destructive consequences for the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, significant components of immunity, such as the development of the immune response and the concept of immune tolerance, are largely dictated by the commensal residents of the microbiome. When this community of microbes is imbalanced, perhaps as the result of a pathogen invasion, stress, or immune gene deficiency, a pathological cycle of localized inflammation, endothelial barrier compromise, translocation of gut-derived products, and systemic inflammation may ensue. If these pathologies enable access of gut and microbial metabolites and immune molecules to the CNS across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and studies of the gut-brain axis support this hypothesis, a worsening of cognitive deficits and psychiatric symptoms is predicted to occur in susceptible individuals with schizophrenia. In this chapter, we review the role of microbes in various stages of this model and how these organisms may contribute to documented phenotypes of schizophrenia.

Five pharmacists have been appointed as members of an expert interdisciplinary health care team tasked with taking care of all adult COVID‐19 patients in Shanghai in a designated hospital, the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (SPHCC). They work with pharmacists at SPHCC, having responsibilities that include drug supplies, dispensing, pharmacy intravenous admixture services (PIVAS), prescription audits, medication reconciliations, pharmacotherapy, therapeutic drug monitoring, and patient education. Due to the pandemic, pharmacy operations in all hospitals are modified to adhere to guidelines for infection risk mitigation and personnel protection. Community pharmacies serve as the public access point to health care and medical supplies, providing services beyond dispensing and medication counselling. The establishment of internet hospitals (telehealth facilities) provide new opportunities for delivering pharmaceutical care and working with health care professionals. Pharmacists also participate in evaluating new treatments and keeping health care teams informed of new findings for potential treatment considerations. In response to the critical need for health care professionals in Wuhan, 68 pharmacists from Shanghai went there to work with the local pharmacists. Through assuming new roles and adapting existing practice, pharmacists have acquired invaluable experiences for future practice advancement. In order to assume these responsibilities effectively, pharmacists need to be equipped with the necessary skills for meeting the evolving health care challenges.

They are concerned about their risk of developing COVID-19 as many are immune suppressed from their disease and/or treatment, whether they should stop their advanced therapies, if they will have a worse outcome if/when infected due to their underlying medication condition(s) and if they will have drug availability, especially with press (without much data) coverage suggesting hydroxychloroquine may be used in COVID-19 infection causing diversion of medication supply. This article discusses how the pandemic affects people with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Preliminarily, articles seem to suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases may not have more infections from SARS-CoV-2 and similar outcomes to age and gender matched patients, but fear of rheumatic medications increasing their risk, drug shortages, and work exposure all are concerns for patients. RECENT FINDINGS: The long term effects of the pandemic in patients with rheumatic diseases will not be known until much later and likely include stressors flaring disease (fear, illness, job loss, social isolation), post-traumatic stress, flaring due to stopping medications, less physician visits with subsequent under-treatment, and increases in chronic concomitant fatigue, pain, fibromyalgia.",2020-04-30,"Pope, Janet E.",Curr Treatm Opt Rheumatol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/19bc9c316614e8057f6c917116671f5d05452ed5.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7191545.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40674-020-00145-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32355607/,216650219

Virtual care can improve access to healthcare services, particularly for those in remote locations or with health conditions that make seeing a doctor in person difficult or unsafe. However, virtual walk-in clinic models that do not connect patients with their own doctors can lead to fragmented, lower quality care.

Herein, we evaluated the feasibility of performing nanofiltration of platelet lysates and determined the impact on expansion of bone marrow-derived MSCs. Methods: Platelet lysates were prepared by freeze-thawing of pathogen-reduced (Intercept®) PCs suspended in 65% storage solution (SPP+) and 35% plasma, and by serum-conversion of PCs suspended in 100% plasma. Lysates were added to the MSC growth media at 10% (v/v), filtered, and subjected to cascade nanofiltration on 35 and 19-nm Planova filters. Media supplemented with 10% starting platelet lysates or FBS were used as the controls. Impacts of nanofiltration on the growth media composition, removal of platelet extracellular vesicles (PEVs), and MSC expansion were evaluated. Results: Nanofiltration did not detrimentally affect contents of total protein and growth factors, or the biochemical composition. The clearance factor of PEVs was over 3 log values. Expansion, of proliferation, membrane markers, differentiation potential, and immunosuppressive properties of cells in nanofiltered media were consistently better than those expanded in FBS-supplemented media. Compared to FBS, chondrogenesis and osteogenesis genes were expressed more in nanofiltered media, and there were fewer senescent cells over six passages. Conclusions: Nanofiltration of growth media supplemented with two types of platelet lysates, including one prepared from pathogen-reduced PCs, is technically feasible.

The viral envelope (E) protein, the principal surface protein of viral particles, plays a vital role in viral entry and fusion. In this study, two peptides derived from domain II (DII) and the stem of the TMUV envelope protein, TP1 and TP2, respectively, were tested for their antiviral activity. TP1 and TP2 inhibited TMUV infection in BHK-21 cells, and their 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were 14.19 mg/L and 7.64 mg/L, respectively. Viral inhibition assays in different cell lines of avian origin showed that the inhibitory effects of TP1 and TP2 are not cell type dependent. Moreover, TP2 also exhibited inhibitory activity against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. The two peptides inhibited antibody-mediated TMUV infection of duck peripheral blood lymphocytes. Co-immunoprecipitation assays and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) indicated that both peptides interact with the surface of the TMUV virion. RNase digestion assays confirmed the release of viral RNA following incubation with TP1, while incubation with TP1 or TP2 interfered with the binding between TMUV and cells.

However, the predictive power of each of these indicators in disease classification and prognosis remains largely unclear. Methods we retrospectively collected information on the above parameters in 142 patients with COVID-19, stratifying them by survival or disease severity. Findings CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM% and ORF1ab Ct were significantly altered between survivors and non-survivors. LYM%, CRP and IL-6 were the most sensitive and reliable factors in distinguishing between survivors and non-survivors.

Here we combined screening of phage display random peptide libraries with a unique computer algorithm “Mapitope” to identify the discontinuous epitope of 80R, a potent neutralizing human anti-SARS monoclonal antibody against the spike protein. Using two different types of random peptide libraries which display cysteine-constrained loops or linear 13–15-mer peptides, independent panels containing 42 and 18 peptides were isolated, respectively. These peptides, which had no apparent homologous motif within or between the peptide pools and spike protein, were deconvoluted into amino acid pairs (AAPs) by Mapitope and the statistically significant pairs (SSPs) were defined. Mapitope analysis of the peptides was first performed on a theoretical model of the spike and later on the genuine crystal structure. Three clusters (A, B and C) were predicted on both structures with remarkable overlap. Cluster A ranked the highest in the algorithm in both models and coincided well with the sites of spike protein that are in contact with the receptor, consistent with the observation that 80R functions as a potent entry inhibitor.

They have served as models for peptic ulcer disease, carotenoid metabolism, cystic fibrosis, and drug emesis screening, among others. Most research ferrets are males, due to estrus-related health problems in females. They may be housed conventionally and are easy to care for when their biology and behavior are understood. Due to the small number of ferret suppliers, animals are often shipped long distances, requiring air transport and intermediate handlers. It is important to minimize shipment stress, especially with weanling and pregnant animals. Additional expertise is required for success with pregnant and whelping ferrets and for rearing of neonates. The animals have specific dietary requirements, and proper nutrition is key.

Replication of PHEV in a porcine kidney-derived cell line (PK-15 cells) caused an extensive CPE, leading to the destruction of the entire monolayer and the death of the infected cells. Staining with Hoechst 33,342 revealed morphological changes in the nuclei and chromatin fragmentation. In addition, PHEV caused DNA fragmentation detectable by agarose gel electrophoresis 48 h post-infection, increasing with the incubation time. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased with the incubation time and reached a maximum at 96 h post-infection, as determined using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy of cells that were stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI). Moreover, as is commonly observed for coronavirus infections of other animals, the activities of the effecter caspase, caspase-3, and the initiator caspases, caspase-8 and caspase-9, which are representative factors in the death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, respectively, were increased in PHEV-infected PK-15 cells. Moreover, the tripeptide pan-ICE (caspase) inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK blocked PHEV-induced apoptosis but did not have an effect on virus production by 96 h post-infection. These results suggested that PHEV induces apoptosis in PK-15 cells via a caspase-dependent pathway. Apoptotic death of infected cells is detrimental to animals because it causes cell and tissue destruction. Although the pathological characteristics of PHEV are largely unknown, apoptosis may be the pathological basis of the lesions resulting from PHEV infection.",2013-06-12,"Lan, Yungang; Zhao, Kui; Wang, Gaili; Dong, Bo; Zhao, Jiakuan; Tang, Bo; Lu, Huijun; Gao, Wei; Chang, Lingzhu; Jin, Zhao; Gao, Feng; He, Wenqi",Virus Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/83e934a16d3fcdcac78ed1b0608536864411079e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114423.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.05.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23770152/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170213002025; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170213002025,28649466

It is crucial to understand building airtightness during construction and retrofitting to achieve a suitable envelope airtightness which is essential for obtaining a desirable building energy efficiency, durability and indoor environment. As a convenient means of measurement, the current steady pressurisation method has long been accepted as a standard testing method for measuring building airtightness. It offers an intuitive and robust approach for measuring building airtightness and performing building diagnostics. However, it also has some shortcomings that are mainly related to its high pressure measurement, requirement for skilful operation, long test duration and change to the building envelope. Efforts have been made by manufacturers and researchers to further improve its accuracy and practicality with much progress achieved. Work has also been done to develop alternative methods that can overcome some of the issues. This paper provides a practical review on the incumbent methodology and efforts that have been made over the past decades in research and development of other methods to achieve a similar purpose. It compares them in relation to aspects that are considered important in achieving an accurate, quick and practical measurement of building airtightness and the finding shows other methods such as acoustic and unsteady technique have their own advantages over the steady pressurisation method but also add some of their own restrictions, which therefore makes them suited for different applications.",2020-10-31,"Zheng, Xiaofeng; Cooper, Edward; Gillott, Mark; Wood, Christopher",Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0d6b826838ae89b72e09fe9ad9ce61fb09eb9659.json,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032120303403; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1364032120303403,220648087

We here describe a novel nucleic acid amplification method based on a whispering gallery mode active resonator and discuss its potential molecular diagnostic application. By implanting nanoclusters as active compounds, this active resonator operates without tapered fiber coupling and emits a strong photoluminescence signal with low background in the wavelength of low absorption in an aqueous environment that is typical of biosensors. Our method also offers an extremely low detection threshold down to a single copy within 10 min due to the strong light-matter interaction in a nano-gap structure.

Cyclophilins, a family of host peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), play a pivotal role in the life cycles of many viruses and therefore represent an attractive target for broad-spectrum antiviral development. We report here the pangenotypic anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity of a small-molecule cyclophilin inhibitor (SMCypI). Mechanistic and modeling studies revealed that the SMCypI bound to cyclophilin A in competition with cyclosporine (CsA), inhibited its PPIase activity, and disrupted the CypA-nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) interaction. Resistance selection showed that the lead SMCypI hardly selected amino acid substitutions conferring low-level or no resistance in vitro. Interestingly, the SMCypI selected D320E and Y321H substitutions, located in domain II of the NS5A protein. These substitutions were previously associated with low-level resistance to cyclophilin inhibitors such as alisporivir. Finally, the SMCypI inhibited the replication of other members of the Flaviviridae family with higher 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) than for HCV. Thus, because of its chemical plasticity and simplicity of synthesis, our new family of SMCypIs represents a promising new class of drugs with the potential for broad-spectrum anti-Flaviviridae activity as well as an invaluable tool to explore the role of cyclophilins in viral life cycles.",2018-06-26,"Nevers, Quentin; Ruiz, Isaac; Ahnou, Nazim; Donati, Flora; Brillet, Rozenn; Softic, Laurent; Chazal, Maxime; Jouvenet, Nolwenn; Fourati, Slim; Baudesson, Camille; Bruscella, Patrice; Gelin, Muriel; Guichou, Jean-François; Pawlotsky, Jean-Michel; Ahmed-Belkacem, Abdelhakim",Antimicrob Agents Chemother,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/8ee7ec977aa10ef8bbe5633d5dc6bb9793572508.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1c60d93cd686bb14fac65510ad3de47cf8b9332c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6021681.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00126-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29760125/,46890746

Soon after the trial began, each volunteer experienced a “cytokine storm”, a dramatic increase in cytokine concentrations. The monoclonal antibody, TGN1412, raised serum concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines το very hiγh values during the first day, while lymphocyte and monocyte concentrations plummeted. Because the subjects were healthy and had no prior indications of immune deficiency, this event provided an unusual opportunity to study the dynamic interactions of cytokines and other measured parameters. Here, the response histories of nine cytokines have been modeled by a set of linear ordinary differential equations. A general search procedure identifies parameters of the model, whose response fits the data well during the five-day measurement period. The eighteenth-order model reveals plausible cause-and-effect relationships among the cytokines, showing how each cytokine induces or inhibits other cytokines. It suggests that perturbations in IL2, IL8, and IL10 have the most significant inductive effect, while IFN-γ and IL12 have the greatest inhibiting effect on other cytokine concentrations. Although TNF-α is a major pro-inflammatory factor, IFN-γ and three other cytokines have faster initial and median response to TGN1412 infusion. Principal-component analysis of the data reveals three clusters of similar cytokine responses: [TNF-α, IL1, IL10], [IFN-γ, IL2, IL4, IL8, and IL12], and [IL6]. IL1, IL6, IL10, and TNF-α have the highest degree of variability in response to uncertain initial conditions, exogenous effects, and parameter estimates.

This evolution is related to the peculiar modes of transmission of the disease and to the globalization and lifestyle of the 21st century that created the perfect scenario for virus spread. Even though research has not evidenced particular susceptibility of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory treatments were considered potential risk factors. In this context, initiating treatments with these agents should be cautiously weighted and regular ongoing treatments shall be continued, while the dose of corticosteroids should be reduced whenever possible. Due to the increased risk of contamination, elective endoscopic procedures and surgeries should be postponed and IBD online appointments shall be considered. IBD patients shall also follow the recommendations provided to the general population, such as minimization of contact with infected or suspected patients and to wash hands frequently.

As advancements in technology occur, more people these days are using social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Due to the increase in social media's popularity, the types of behaviors are now easier to group and study as this is important to know the behavior of users via social networking in order to analyze similarities of certain behavior types and this can be used to predict what they post as well as what they comment, share, and like on social networking sites. However, very few review studies have undertaken grouping according to similarities and differences to predict the personality and behavior of individuals with the help of social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to collect data from previous researches and to analyze the methods they have used. This chapter reviewed 30 research studies on the topic of behavioral analysis using the social media from 2015 to 2017. This research is based on the method of previous publications and analyzed the results, limitations, and number of users to draw conclusions. Our results indicated that the percentage of completed research on the Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram show that 50% of the studies were done on Twitter, 27% on Facebook, and 23% on Instagram. Twitter seems to be more popular and recent than the other two spheres as there are more studies on it. Further, we extracted the studies based on the year and graphs in 2015 which indicated that more research has been done on Facebook to analyze the behavior of users and the trends are decreasing in the following year. However, more studies have been done on Twitter in 2016 than any other social media. The results also show the classifications based on different methods to analyze individual behavior. However, most of the studies have been done on Twitter, as it is more popular and newer than Facebook and Instagram particularly from 2015 to 2017, and more research needs to be done on other social media spheres in order to analyze the trending behaviors of users. This study should be useful to obtain knowledge about the methods used to analyze user behavior with description, limitations, and results. Although some researchers collect demographic information on users’ gender on Facebook, others on Twitter do not. This lack of demographic data, which is typically available in more traditional sources such as surveys, has created a new focus on developing methods to work out these traits as a means of expanding Big Data research.",2019-12-31,"Singh, Amandeep; Halgamuge, Malka N.; Moses, Beulah",Social Network Analytics,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2ec38198b8382246c22ad30fdab26ca53f32ef1c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149696.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128154588000050; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128154588000050,149636843

A comprehensive strategy, including surveillance, diagnostics, research, and clinical treatment is urgently needed to win the battle against COVID-19. Recently, numerous studies reported the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients. Yet, the incidence and viral transmission from the asymptomatic cases are not apparent yet. AIM: this study aims to systematically review the published literature on SARS-CoV-2 in the asymptomatic patients to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among asymptomatic cases, as well as describe its epidemiological and clinical significance. METHOD: the literature was searched through four scientific databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Science Direct. RESULTS: a total of 63 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria where the majority of the reported studies were from China. However, there was a lack of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological studies from several countries worldwide, tracing the actual incidence of COVID-19, especially in asymptomatic patients. Studies with a large sample size (n>1000) estimated that percentage of people contracting SARS-CoV-2 and are likely to be asymptomatic ranges from 1.2-12.9%. However, the other studies with a smaller sample size reported a much higher incidence and indicated that up to 87.9% of COVID-19 infected individuals could be asymptomatic. Most of these studies indicated that asymptopatics are a potential source of infection to the community. CONCLUSION: this review highlighted the need for more robust and well-designed studies to better estimate COVID-19 incidence among asymptomatic patients worldwide. The early identification of the asymptomatic cases, as well as monitoring and tracing close contact, could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.",2020-07-02,"Al-Sadeq, Duaa W.; Nasrallah, Gheyath K.",Int J Infect Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7a5c7ed1ed58827df36e07e7fa5e9158b2582b1b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7330573.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32623083/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220305336; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220305336?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.06.098,220282840

Osteonecrosis incidence was 6.7% with corticosteroid treatment of >2 g (prednisone-equivalent). Systemic lupus erythematosus patients had positive correlations between dose and osteonecrosis incidence. Each 10 mg/d increase was associated with a 3.6% increase in osteonecrosis rate, and >20 mg/d resulted in a higher osteonecrosis incidence.

Four SARS-CoV PLpro lead inhibitors were tested against MERS-CoV PLpro, none of which were effective against MERS-CoV PLpro. Structure and sequence alignments revealed that two residues, Y269 and Q270, responsible for inhibitor binding to SARS-CoV PLpro, were replaced by T274 and A275 in MERS-CoV PLpro, making critical binding interactions difficult to form for similar types of inhibitors. High-throughput screening (HTS) of 25 000 compounds against both PLpro enzymes identified a small fragment-like noncovalent dual inhibitor. Mode of inhibition studies by enzyme kinetics and competition surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses suggested that this compound acts as a competitive inhibitor with an IC(50) of 6 μM against MERS-CoV PLpro, indicating that it binds to the active site, whereas it acts as an allosteric inhibitor against SARS-CoV PLpro with an IC(50) of 11 μM. These results raised the possibility that inhibitor recognition specificity of MERS-CoV PLpro may differ from that of SARS-CoV PLpro. In addition, inhibitory activity of this compound was selective for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpro enzymes over two human homologues, the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases 1 and 3 (hUCH-L1 and hUCH-L3).",2015-03-06,"Lee, Hyun; Lei, Hao; Santarsiero, Bernard D.; Gatuz, Joseph L.; Cao, Shuyi; Rice, Amy J.; Patel, Kavankumar; Szypulinski, Michael Z.; Ojeda, Isabel; Ghosh, Arun K.; Johnson, Michael E.",ACS Chemical Biology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4890ec101c35e1ecb16aba2cc8671009f28f090f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/32d91aac18de4768feb8a3b9dd69254941bc65f7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1f245f2e3e8fa0a1b48bee7114b782405ed2381e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4845099.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25746232/; https://doi.org/10.1021/cb500917m; https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/cb500917m,6744473

A total of 135 respondents were interviewed using semi‐structured questionnaires, between February and May 2017. The study showed that direct contacts between bats and humans are relatively common. Bat bushmeat appeared to be an occasional meat resource; 40% of respondents consume bats with a median annual consumption of three, and 28% of respondents hunt them. About 22% of the respondents reported children catching bats. Indirect contact also appeared to be common; 55% of hunters use caves as shelters and 67% of interviewees eat fruits previously chewed by bats. Bat consumption varied significantly between regions (from 0% to 87%) and between pygmies and bantus in the extreme south‐east of Cameroon. The study revealed considerable diversity in practices among interviewees, most of them being subsistence cultivators and relying on self‐hunted bushmeat. Geographical diversity of contacts and perceptions regarding bats in Cameroon emphasizes the need to adjust zoonotic pathogen surveillance and education campaigns to the specificities of the communities and their context of interaction with wildlife.",2019-01-24,"Baudel, Helene; De Nys, Helene; Mpoudi Ngole, Eitel; Peeters, Martine; Desclaux, Alice",Zoonoses Public Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/520e6589a7c10914c49b3ed2af83f5ef84bc5f3c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165775.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30677236/; https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12563,59251314

However, bats also are reservoirs for a number of high-consequence zoonoses, including paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, and lyssaviruses. The variety of viruses that bats harbor might be related to their evolutionary diversity, ability to fly large distances, long lifespans, and gregarious roosting behaviors. Every year a festival takes place in Idanre, Nigeria, in which males of all ages enter designated caves to capture bats; persons are forbidden from entering the caves outside of these festivities. Festival participants use a variety of techniques to capture bats, but protective equipment rarely is used, placing hunters at risk for bat scratches and bites. Many captured bats are prepared as food, but some are transported to markets in other parts of the country for sale as bushmeat. Bats also are presented to dignitaries in elaborate rituals. The health consequences of contact with these bats are unknown, but a number of viruses have been previously identified among Nigerian bats, including lyssaviruses, pegiviruses, and coronaviruses.

The policy frames identified responded to the challenges these regions currently face. The Association of Southeast Asian Nation’s struggle with re-emerging diseases has led to favouring a securitisation approach to health, the European Union approaches health as a cross-cutting policy issue, the Southern African Development Community presents health as a driver for development, and while the Union of South American Nations emphasises health as a human right and addresses the social determinants of health as an ethical imperative. Overall, these policy frames were useful in analysing the framing of health in foreign policy at the regional level.

This study explored family caregivers’ activities and their perceptions and practices related to disease transmission and prevention in public hospitals. METHODS: Trained qualitative researchers conducted a total of 48 hours of observation in 3 public tertiary care hospitals and 12 in-depth interviews with family caregivers. RESULTS: Family caregivers provided care 24 hours a day, including bedside nursing, cleaning care, and psychologic support. During observations, family members provided 2,065 episodes of care giving, 75% (1,544) of which involved close contact with patients. We observed family caregivers washing their hands with soap on only 4 occasions. The majority of respondents said diseases are transmitted through physical contact with surfaces and objects that have been contaminated with patient secretions and excretions, and avoiding contact with these contaminated objects would help prevent disease. CONCLUSION: Family caregivers are at risk for hospital-acquired infection from their repeated exposure to infectious agents combined with their inadequate hand hygiene and knowledge about disease transmission. Future research should explore potential strategies to improve family caregivers’ knowledge about disease transmission and reduce family caregiver exposures, which may be accomplished by improving care provided by health care workers.",2014-03-01,"Islam, M.

In total, 580 individuals were presented with a questionnaire. A significant proportion of individuals had chronic medical disorders, e.g. diabetes mellitus (132, 22.8%) and hypertension (147, 25.3%). Pilgrims had a low level of education and a low employment rate. Sixty (10.3%) were treated with statins for hypercholesterolemia. Four hundred and fourty-seven pilgrims were presented a questionnaire on returning home. A total of 74 travellers (16.6%) experienced fever during their stay in Saudi Arabia (67 attended a doctor) and 271 (60.6%) had cough (259 attended a doctor); 70 travellers with cough were febrile (25.9%). Seventy per cent of the travellers who suffered cough episodes developed their first symptoms within 3 days, suggesting a human to human transmission of the responsible pathogen, with short incubation time as evidenced by a bimodal distribution of cough in two peaks at a 24 h interval. None of demographical and socioeconomic characteristics, underlying diseases or vaccination against influenza significantly affected the occurrence of cough. Diabetes correlated with an increased risk of febrile cough (OR = 2.02 (1.05–3.89)) as well as unemployment (OR = 2.22 (0.91–5.53)). Use of statins had no significant influence on the occurrence of cough and/or fever during the pilgrimage.

Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. While uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall strategy to limit infection risk indoors. Appropriate building engineering controls include sufficient and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particle filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding overcrowding. Often, such measures can be easily implemented and without much cost, but if only they are recognised as significant in contributing to infection control goals. We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, including hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public transport, in parallel with effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distancing and hand hygiene), would be an additional important measure globally to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby protect healthcare workers, patients and the general public.",2020-05-27,"Morawska, Lidia; Tang, Julian W.; Bahnfleth, William; Bluyssen, Philomena M.; Boerstra, Atze; Buonanno, Giorgio; Cao, Junji; Dancer, Stephanie; Floto, Andres; Franchimon, Francesco; Haworth, Charles; Hogeling, Jaap; Isaxon, Christina; Jimenez, Jose L.; Kurnitski, Jarek; Li, Yuguo; Loomans, Marcel; Marks, Guy; Marr, Linsey C.; Mazzarella, Livio; Krikor Melikov, Arsen; Miller, Shelly; Milton, Donald K.; Nazaroff, William; Nielsen, Peter V.; Noakes, Catherine; Peccia, Jordan; Querol, Xavier; Sekhar, Chandra; Seppänen, Olli; Tanabe, Shin-ichi; Tellier, Raymond; Wai Tham, Kwok; Wargocki, Pawel; Wierzbicka, Aneta; Yao, Maosheng",Environ Int,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ca6e6ef7fcddbd289df668990b893613e806dd4d.json,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32521345/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412020317876; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020317876?v=s5,218891075

This topic is currently arousing great interest, and a growing number of papers are being published. Aim of this study is to investigate the timing of recovery from OD and GD in a real-life population hospitalized for COVID-19. METHODS: We followed up by a phone interview the first 100 patients discharged a month earlier from three Italian non-intensive care wards. RESULTS: All 100 patients were Caucasian, mean age was 65 years, 60% were males. Forty-two patients (mean age 63 years) experienced subjective chemosensory dysfunctions (29 OD and 41 GD): the male/female ratio was 2:1; 83% reported a complete or near complete recovery at follow-up. The recovery rate was not significantly different between males and females. The mean duration of OD and GD was 18 and 16 days, respectively. The mean recovery time from OD or GD resulted significantly longer for females than for males (26 vs 14 days, P = 0.009). Among the 42 symptomatic, the mean age of males was significantly higher than that of females (66 vs 57 years, P = 0.04), while the opposite was observed in the 58 asymptomatic patients (60 vs 73 years, P = 0.0018). CONCLUSIONS: Recovery from OD or GD was rapid, occurring within 4 weeks in most patients. Chemosensory dysfunctions in women was less frequent, but longer lasting.

Molecular imaging techniques such as 2-deoxy-2-((18)F)fluoro-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) would be an invaluable method of tracking disease in vivo, but this technique has not been reported in the literature. Thus, the aim of this study was to establish baseline imaging characteristics of PET/computed tomography (CT) with (18)F-FDG in the ferret model. Twelve healthy female ferrets were anesthetized and underwent combined PET/CT scanning. After the images were fused, volumes of interest (VOIs) were generated in the liver, heart, thymus, and bilateral lung fields. For each VOI, standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated. Additional comparisons were made between radiotracer uptake periods (60, 90, and >90 minutes), intravenous and intraperitoneal injections of (18)F-FDG, and respiratory gated and ungated acquisitions. Pulmonary structures and the surrounding thoracic and upper abdominal anatomy were readily identified on the CT scans of all ferrets and were successfully fused with PET.

Sixty- to 90-minute uptake periods were sufficient to separate tissues based on background SUV activity. No gross differences in image quality were seen between intraperitoneal and intravenous injections of (18)F-FDG. Respiratory gating also did not have a significant impact on image quality of lung parenchyma. The authors concluded that (18)F-FDG PET and CT imaging can be performed successfully in normal healthy ferrets with the parameters identified in this study. They obtained similar imaging features and uptake measurements with and without respiratory gating as well as with intraperitoneal and intravenous (18)F-FDG injections. (18)F-FDG PET and CT can be a valuable resource for the in vivo tracking of disease progression in future studies that employ the ferret model.",2012-03-01,"Wu, Albert; Zheng, Huaiyu; Kraenzle, Jennifer; Biller, Ashley; Vanover, Carol D.; Proctor, Mary; Sherwood, Leslie; Steffen, Marlene; Ng, Chin; Mollura, Daniel J.; Jonsson, Colleen B.",ILAR Journal,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/dd4ab978f42e3bee67824dbbb9a81ac6afa2bffd.json,,https://academic.oup.com/ilarjournal/article-pdf/53/1/E9/1855772/ilar-53-9.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1093/ilar.53.1.9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23382267/,38158770

In this study, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics, tolerance and immunity of this kind of antibody in macaques and rats. Results showed that the F(ab′)2 fragments had a normal metabolism in injected animals. The general physiological indexes did not differ between animals injected with anti-SARS–CoV F(ab′)2 or saline. However, a mild inflammatory response in local injection site and a moderate immune response against this antibody in the successively injected animals were observed, which however recovered 3 weeks after the last injection. The antibody titring from 1:100 to 400 against the equine anti-SARS–CoV F(ab′)2 in the inoculated hosts could be detected at week 2 during the successive injections of the equine F(ab′)2. The considerable safety of this antibody used in primates and the fact that the immune system of the host can be motivated by post-injection of the F(ab′)2 indicate that this type of anti-SARS–CoV antibody can be used for prevention and treatment of SASR, especially at the early stage of this virus infection.

In South Korea, PGAR is prevalent in piglets naturally infected with PEDV. Piglets naturally co-infected with PEDV and PGAR appeared to have severe and prolonged diarrhea that was distinct from that commonly observed. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of PGAR co-infection on PEDV pathogenicity in piglets. Thirty-six colostrum-deprived, one-day old, Large White-Duroc crossbred pigs were randomly divided into four equal groups: PEDV, PEDV/PGAR, PGAR, and control groups. The piglets were euthanized at 1, 2, or 3 days post-inoculation (DPI) to measure the villous height:crypt depth (VH:CD) ratio and to collect fecal samples for RT-PCR and virus isolation. No significant differences in mean VH:CD ratio and clinical symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and anorexia) were observed between the PEDV/PGAR-infected and PEDV-infected groups of piglets at 1, 2 and 3 DPI; however, at 2 and 3 DPI, PGAR was detected in all fecal samples by RT-PCR and virus isolation. These findings failed to detect any interaction between PEDV and porcine rotavirus in the small intestines of piglets, suggesting that concurrent infection of PGAR may not synergistically enhance intestinal villous atrophy of piglets with PEDV disease. We propose that the severe diarrhea exhibited in PEDV and PGAR co-infected piglets may be more associated with the immunity level of the host rather than to any synergistic effect of PGAR on PEDV enteritis.",2007-08-28,"Jung, Kwonil; Kang, Bo-Kyu; Lee, Chul-Seung; Song, Dae-Sub",Res Vet Sci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/9ccefcd9e0eae0cb8dfbbf98a820b7b7d0f0fef3.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111867.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528807001828; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17727905/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528807001828,33369682

METHODS: The survey was conducted among the members of the ISOLS (International Society of Limb Salvage) and the EMSOS (European Musculo-Skeletal Oncology Society). The survey consisted of 20 questions (single, multiple-response, ranked): origin and surgical experience of the participant (four questions), potential disruption of healthcare (12 questions), and influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the particular physician (four questions). A matrix with four different response options was created for the particular surgical procedures). RESULTS: One hundred forty-nine physicians from five continents completed the survey. Of the respondents, 20.1% and 20.7% stated that surgery for life-threatening sarcomas were stopped or delayed, respectively. Even when the malignancy was expected to involve infiltration of a neurovascular bundle or fracture of a bone, still 13.8% and 14.7% of the respondents, respectively, stated that surgery was not performed. In cases of pending fractures of bone tumors, 37.5 to 46.2% of operations were canceled. CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic caused a significant reduction in healthcare (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) for malignancies of the musculoskeletal system. Delaying or stopping these treatments is life-threatening or can cause severe morbidity, pain, and loss of function. Although the coronavirus disease causes severe medical complications, serious collateral damage including death due to delayed or untreated sarcomas should be avoided.

However, a universal antiviral strategy for producing safe and immunogenic inactivated vaccines is lacking. Here, we report an antiviral strategy using the novel singlet oxygen ((1)O(2))-generating agent LJ002 to inactivate enveloped viruses and provide effective protection against viral infection. Our results demonstrated that LJ002 efficiently generated (1)O(2) in solution and living cells. Nevertheless, LJ002 exhibited no signs of acute toxicity in vitro or in vivo. The (1)O(2) produced by LJ002 oxidized lipids in the viral envelope and consequently destroyed the viral membrane structure, thus inhibiting the viral and cell membrane fusion necessary for infection. Moreover, the (1)O(2)-based inactivated pseudorabies virus (PRV) vaccine had no effect on the content of the viral surface proteins. Immunization of mice with LJ002-inactiviated PRV vaccine harboring comparable antigen induced more neutralizing antibody responses and efficient protection against PRV infection than conventional formalin-inactivated vaccine. Additionally, LJ002 inactivated a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses. Together, our results may provide a new paradigm of using broad-spectrum, highly effective inactivants functioning through (1)O(2)-mediated lipid oxidation for developing antivirals that target the viral membrane fusion process.",2020-06-08,"Zeng, Lei; Wang, Meng-Di; Ming, Sheng-Li; Li, Guo-Li; Yu, Peng-Wei; Qi, Yan-Li; Jiang, Da-Wei; Yang, Guo-Yu; Wang, Jiang; Chu, Bei-Bei",Redox Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/eacf1357d26ab849f60444cfb447530f85b56026.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7278711.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213231720308065; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2020.101601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32535542/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231720308065?v=s5,219534744

Dexamethasone is commonly used for antiemetic prophylaxis with systemic therapy for cancer. However, dexamethasone is associated with increased risk of viral and respiratory infections, and causes lymphopenia, which is associated with worse outcomes during COVID-19 infections. Our purpose was to minimize dexamethasone exposure during antiemetic prophylaxis for systemic therapy for solid tumors during the COVID-19 pandemic, while maintaining control of nausea and emesis. METHODS: We convened an expert panel to systematically review the literature and formulate consensus recommendations. RESULTS: No studies considered the impact of dexamethasone-based antiemetic regimens on the risk and severity of COVID-19 infection. Expert consensus recommended modifications to the 2019 Cancer Care Ontario Antiemetic Recommendations. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should prescribe the minimally effective dose of dexamethasone for antiemetic prophylaxis. Single-day dexamethasone dosing is recommended over multi-day dosing for regimens with high emetogenic risk excluding high-dose cisplatin, preferably in combination with palonosetron, netupitant, and olanzapine.

On the other hand, these concept-initiated studies indicate the directions forwards the enhancement of predictability, of which we need to use the neural network instead of logistic regression that was used in those concept-initiated studies to enhance the predictability. In this proof-of-concept study, we attempt to apply the neural network to modeling the cause-mutation relationship to predict the possible mutation positions, and then we use the amino acid mutating probability to predict the would-be-mutated amino acids at predicted positions.

We analysed two OAS1 regions encompassing alternatively spliced exons. While the region carrying the splice-site variant is neutrally evolving, a signature of long-standing balancing selection was observed across an alternative exon 7. Analysis of variants in this exon identified an insertion/deletion polymorphism (rs11352835, A/−) that originates predicted products with distinct C termini. This variant is located along the major branch of the haplotype genealogy, suggesting that it may represent the selection target. A case/control study for MS indicated that rs11352835 is associated with disease susceptibility (for an allelic model with the deleted allele predisposing to MS, OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.072–1.513, p = 0.010). No association was found between rs10774671 and MS. As the two SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium in Europeans, the previously reported association between rs10774671 and MS susceptibility might be driven by rs11352835, possibly explaining the contrasting results previously observed for the splice-site polymorphism. Thus, we describe a novel susceptibility variant for MS in OAS1 and show that population genetic analyses can be instrumental to the identification of selection targets and, consequently, of functional polymorphisms with an effect on phenotypic traits.

These can “emerge” as new diseases by expanding their geographical range or by jumping species (from plants to plants, or from animals to humans). Emerging diseases place an additional burden on developing countries which are often struggling to manage the diseases they already have. New diseases spread through weather, insects or other vectors, or by the movement of people, animals or goods. This study examines the role of cross-border travel in the spread of diseases. A survey of travelers and of residents along the Malawi-Mozambique border found that most cross it frequently and that they rarely travel empty-handed, often taking plants and animals with them.

The emergence of new strains will continue to pose challenges to public health and the scientific communities. The recent flu pandemic caused by a swine-origin influenza virus A/H1N1 (S-OIV) presents an opportunity to examine virulence factors, the spread of the infection and to prepare for major influenza outbreaks in the future. The virus contains a novel constellation of gene segments, the nearest known precursors being viruses found in swine and it probably arose through reassortment of two viruses of swine origin. Specific markers for virulence can be evaluated in the viral genome, PB1-F2 is a molecular marker of pathogenicity but is not present in the new S-OIV. While attention was focused on a threat of an avian influenza H5N1 pandemic emerging from Asia, a novel influenza virus of swine origin emerged in North America, and is now spreading worldwide. However, S-OIV demonstrates that even serotypes already encountered in past human pandemics may constitute new pandemic threats. There are concerns that this virus may mutate or reassort with existing influenza viruses giving rise to more transmissible or more pathogenic viruses. The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic virus was relatively mild in its first wave and acquired more virulence when it returned in the winter. Thus preparedness on a global scale against a potential more virulent strain is highly recommended. Most isolates of the new S-OIVs are susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors, and currently a vaccine against the pandemic strain is being manufactured and will be available this fall.

The conditions for Hopf bifurcation and Turing bifurcation are gained and, in particular, exact Turing domain is found in the two parameters space.

These new heptad-repeats differ from those previously reported in other viruses because of the presence of all the hydrophobic amino acids in positions a or d, and because they are not predicted to form coiled coils by current methods and thus they have not been detected previously in any rhabdoviruses. The two or three heptad-repeat regions were the only parts of the glycoprotein with at least three successive heptad-repeats in all the rhabdoviral sequences studied and had low sequence variability among the members of each of the rhabdoviral genus but show no sequence similarity among the different genus.

For example, Ribonucleases (RNases) are enzymes relevant to several biologic processes; then, theoretical and experimental study of the molecular diversity of Peptide Mass Fingerprints (PMFs) of RNases is useful for drug design. This study introduces a methodology that combines QSAR models, 2D-Electrophoresis (2D-E), MALDI-TOF Mass Spectroscopy (MS), BLAST alignment, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) to explore PMFs of RNases. We illustrate this approach by investigating for the first time the PMFs of a new protein of L. infantum. Here we report and compare new versus old predictive models for RNases based on Topological Indices (TIs) of Markov Pseudo-Folding Lattices. These group of indices called Pseudo-folding Lattice 2D-TIs include: Spectral moments π (k)(x,y), Mean Electrostatic potentials ξ (k)(x,y), and Entropy measures θ (k)(x,y). The accuracy of the models (training/cross-validation) was as follows: ξ (k)(x,y)-model (96.0%/91.7%)>π (k)(x,y)-model (84.7/83.3) > θ (k)(x,y)-model (66.0/66.7). We also carried out a 2D-E analysis of biological samples of L. infantum promastigotes focusing on a 2D-E gel spot of one unknown protein with M<20, 100 and pI <7. MASCOT search identified 20 proteins with Mowse score >30, but not one >52 (threshold value), the higher value of 42 was for a probable DNA-directed RNA polymerase. However, we determined experimentally the sequence of more than 140 peptides. We used QSAR models to predict RNase scores for these peptides and BLAST alignment to confirm some results. We also calculated 3D-folding TIs based on MD experiments and compared 2D versus 3D-TIs on molecular phylogenetic analysis of the molecular diversity of these peptides.

A recent assessment found that nearly one-third (32%, 1,856 species) of the world’s amphibian species are threatened. Amphibians have existed on the earth for over 300 million years, yet in just the last two decades there have been an alarming number of extinctions, nearly 168 species are believed to have gone extinct and at least 2,469 (43%) more have populations that are declining. Infectious diseases have been recognized as one major cause of worldwide amphibian population declines. This could be the result of the appearance of novel pathogens, or it could be that exposure to environmental stressors is increasing the susceptibility of amphibians to opportunistic pathogens. Here I review the potential effects of stressors on disease susceptibility in amphibians and relate this to disease emergence in human and other wildlife populations. I will present a series of case studies that illustrate the role of stress in disease outbreaks that have resulted in amphibian declines. First, I will examine how elevated sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific since the mid-1970s have affected climate over much of the world and could be setting the stage for pathogen-mediated amphibian declines in many regions. Finally, I will discuss how the apparently rapid increase in the prevalence of amphibian limb deformities is linked to the synergistic effects of trematode infection and exposure to chemical contaminants.",2010-03-24,"Kiesecker, Joseph M.",Ecol Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/9732a47edb629782bf6eaf9424291f2d95d88556.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088592.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088592/,

This notion holds true irrespective of the genome type. At first glance the argument seems to be weak in the case of enveloped and non-enveloped RNA viruses with single-stranded (ss) segmented or non-segmented genomes of positive (+) or negative polarity. Here, there are several families infecting V or P only; no systematic relation to arthropods is found. c) In the non-enveloped plant viruses with ss RNA genomes there is a strong tendency for segmentation and individual packaging of the genome pieces. This is in contrast to ss+ RNA animal viruses and can only be explained by massive transmission by seed or insects or both, because individual packaging necessitates a multihit infection. Comparisons demonstrate relationships in the nonstructural proteins of double-stranded and ss+ RNA viruses irrespective of host range, segmentation, and envelope. Similar conclusions apply for the negative-stranded RNA viruses. Thus, viral supergroups can be created that infect V or P and exploit arthropods for infection or transmission or both.

The hemagglutinin (H) glycoprotein is the principle target of neutralizing and protective antibodies against measles. Copy numbers of the H transgene were verified by Southern blot and specific transcription was confirmed by RT-PCR. The H protein was detected by western blot in the membrane fraction of transformed carrot plants. The recombinant protein seemed to have a 8% lower molecular weight than the viral protein.

This study adopts a public health ecology approach to systematically understand the relationship between urbanisation, urban environmental change and human health in China. METHOD: Remote sensing image analysis, based on night light data at five different time periods in recent decades, was used to determine changes to the overall urban area. Through a review of the evidence on the relationships between environmental health, urbanisation and health, we advance a pathway framework for explaining urban human health ecology. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to measure the correlation between disease prevalence and urbanisation level, adding a further dimension to a systemic understanding of urban health. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Urban areas have been increasing spatially, but unevenly, in recent decades, with medium and small cities also expanding rapidly in the past decade. Urbanisation and urban expansion result in changes to land use/coverage change, the urban environment and the residents’ lifestyle, which result in human health problems. Regions with the highest urbanisation level were more inclined to have a high prevalence of chronic disease in recent decades.

The screening of the two miniPEPSCAN libraries resulted in the identification of a surprisingly large number of antibody-binding peptides, while the screening of the large recombinant libraries, using the same Mabs, resulted in the identification of only a small number of peptides. The large number of peptides derived from the small random peptide libraries allowed the determination of consensus sequences. These consensus sequences could be related to small linear and nonlinear parts of the respective epitopes. The small number of peptides derived from the large random peptide libraries could only be related to linear epitopes that were previously mapped using small libraries of overlapping peptides covering the antigenic protein.

However, the success of this strategy requires the prompt onset of therapy within 48 hours of the appearance of clinical symptoms. This requirement may be captured by a compartmental model that monitors the density of infected individuals in terms of the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. We show that such a model can be expressed by a system of delay differential equations with both discrete and distributed delays. The model is analyzed to derive the criterion for disease control based on two critical factors: (i) the profile of treatment rate; and (ii) the level of treatment as a function of time lag in commencing therapy. Numerical results are also obtained to illustrate the feasible region of disease control. Our findings show that due to uncertainty in the attack rate of a pandemic strain, initiating therapy immediately upon diagnosis can significantly increase the likelihood of disease control and substantially reduce the required community-level of treatment. This suggests that reliable diagnostic methods for influenza cases should be rapidly implemented within an antiviral treatment strategy.",2007-08-16,"Alexander, Murray E.; Moghadas, Seyed M.; Röst, Gergely; Wu, Jianhong",Bull Math Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/03c9c4d06fe6dab0aeb8c53321bfd755bb42c4a8.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088798/,

These statutes, despite their frequency, are misguided in terms of the goals of the criminal law and the public health aim of reducing overall burdens of disease, for at least three important reasons. First, they identify individual offenders for punishment, a paradigm that is misplaced in the most typical contexts of transmission of infectious disease and even for HIV/AIDS, despite claims of AIDS exceptionalism. Second, although there are examples of individuals who transmit infectious disease in a manner that fits the criminal law paradigm of identification of individual offenders for deterrence or retribution, these examples are limited and can be accommodated by existing criminal laws not devoted specifically to infectious disease. Third, and most importantly, the current criminal laws regarding HIV/AIDS, like many other criminal laws applied to infectious disease transmission, have been misguided in focusing on punishment of the diseased individual as a wrongful transmitter. Instead of individual offenders, activities that enhance the scale of disease transmission—behaviors that might be characterized as ‘transmission facilitation’—are a more appropriate target for the criminal law. Examples are trafficking in human beings (including sex trafficking, organ trafficking, and labor trafficking), suppression of information about the emergence of infection in circumstances in which there is a legally established obligation to disclose, and intentional or reckless activities to discourage disease treatment or prevention. Difficulties remain with justifications for criminalizing even these behaviors, however, most importantly the need for trust in reducing overall burdens of disease, problems in identifying individual responsible offenders, and potential misalignment between static criminal law and the changing nature of infectious disease.",2011-12-10,"Francis, Leslie Pickering; Francis, John G.",Crim Law Philos,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4d3514cd54dde8a09b365fa5640d81485b8f376a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088803.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088803/,

Imatinib is the first-line treatment of CML; however, many patients are resistant to this drug. In this study, we aimed to compare the differences in expression patterns and functions of time-series genes in imatinib-resistant CML cells under different drug treatments. GSE24946 was downloaded from the GEO database, which included 17 samples of K562-r cells with (n=12) or without drug administration (n=5). Three drug treatment groups were considered for this study: arsenic trioxide (ATO), AMN107, and ATO+AMN107. Each group had one sample at each time point (3, 12, 24, and 48 h). Time-series genes with a ratio of standard deviation/average (coefficient of variation) >0.15 were screened, and their expression patterns were revealed based on Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM). Then, the functional enrichment analysis of time-series genes in each group was performed using DAVID, and the genes enriched in the top ten functional categories were extracted to detect their expression patterns. Different time-series genes were identified in the three groups, and most of them were enriched in the ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Time-series genes in the three treatment groups had different expression patterns and functions. Time-series genes in the ATO group (e.g. CCNA2 and DAB2) were significantly associated with cell adhesion, those in the AMN107 group were related to cellular carbohydrate metabolic process, while those in the ATO+AMN107 group (e.g. AP2M1) were significantly related to cell proliferation and antigen processing.

We address uniform persistence and find that the model has the sharp threshold property, that is, for the basic reproduction number less than one, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, while for the basic reproduction number is above one, a Lyapunov functional is used to show that the endemic equilibrium is globally stable.

Moreover, in this specific endemic situation, and according to the British Society of Thoracic Imaging expert reference group update, we took account of chest CT‐Scan results in the early detection of COVID‐19 pneumonia. Our 2 patients with a confirmed influenza SARS‐CoV‐2virus infection had respiratory distress with lung crackles on auscultation of one or both lungs and with alveolar pulmonary edema on the chest CT‐Scan. The cardiogenic nature of pulmonary edema was ruled out in both cases by a transthoracic echocardiography showing normal systolic and diastolic functions. Our patients were treated by oxygen via face mask in one case and mechanical ventilation as supportive treatment in the other patient.

However, cisplatin resistance is still a challenging issue, and the molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance remain to be fully explored. CLEC4M, a Ca(2+)-dependent C-type lectin, has recently been found to correlate with tumourigenesis. This study mainly focused on whether CLEC4M impacts clinical prognosis and how CLEC4M contributes to cisplatin resistance in NSCLC. Our results found that CLEC4M was correlated with poor prognosis in patients with lung cancer. In addition, a positive association between CLEC4M expression and the IC50 values of cisplatin was found, which suggests that CLEC4M may impact cisplatin sensitivity. In vitro results from cultured A549 and H1299 cells confirmed that CLEC4M could enhance cisplatin resistance, while CLEC4M knockdown led to higher sensitivity to cisplatin in these cells. Further experiments showed that the underlying mechanisms included inhibition of cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis by CLEC4M and improved DNA repair capacity by upregulating XPA and ERCC1 expression. In addition, CLEC4M was able to promote cell migration with or without cisplatin treatment. Collectively, these findings suggest the potential clinical significance of CLEC4M inhibition in overcoming cisplatin resistance in NSCLC patients.",2019-10-19,"Tan, Li-Ming; Li, Xi; Qiu, Cheng-Feng; Zhu, Tao; Hu, Cheng-Ping; Yin, Ji-Ye; Zhang, Wei; Zhou, Hong-Hao; Liu, Zhao-Qian",J Cancer,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3e9d0220802e3e3fba0b25f1e2cd46b9412c4317.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6856750.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31772670/; https://doi.org/10.7150/jca.30139,208073649

However, it also has disadvantages. For example, the rapidity of bacterial protein expression often results in unfolded/misfolded proteins, especially for heterologous proteins that require longer times and/or molecular chaperones to fold correctly. In addition, the highly reductive environment of the bacterial cytosol and the inability of E. coli to perform several eukaryotic post‐translational modifications results in the insoluble expression of proteins that require these modifications for folding and activity. Fortunately, multiple, novel reagents and techniques have been developed that allow for the efficient, soluble production of a diverse range of heterologous proteins in E. coli . This overview describes variables at each stage of a protein expression experiment that can influence solubility and offers a summary of strategies used to optimize soluble expression in E. coli .

Quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction (qRT‐PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to measure PCBP2 messenger RNA and protein expression in glioma tissues or cells. Cell transfection was completed using Lipofectamine 2000. 3‐(4,5‐Dimethylthiazol‐2‐yl)‐2,5‐diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, Transwell assay and flow cytometry assay were used to explore the effects of PCBP2 expression on biological behaviors of glioma cells. Western blot assay was used for the detection of pathway related proteins. Expression of PCBP2 in glioma tissues and cells were higher than that in paracancerous tissues and normal cells (both p < .01). Moreover, the elevated expression of PCBP2 was significantly correlated with tumor size (p = .001) and WHO stage (p = .010). Knockdown of PCBP2 could suppress proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells and promote apoptosis. Besides, the expression of transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) pathway related proteins TGF‐β1, p‐Smad2 and p‐Smad7 were decreased following the downregulation of PCBP2. PCBP2 also inhibited FHL3 expression by binding to FHL3‐3′UTR. The inhibition of FHL3 could reverse the antitumor action caused by PCBP2 silencing. In vivo assay, PCBP2 was also found to inhibit the tumor growth of glioma.

All children ≤5 years of age consecutively admitted to Sultan Qaboos University Hospital in Oman over a 1‐year period between December 2007 and December 2008 with acute respiratory infections were included. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viral detection was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates. Analyses were conducted using univariate statistical methods. Of the 259 infants and young children, at least one respiratory virus was detected in 130 samples (50%). The most prevalent viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 43%; n = 56), adenovirus (15%; n = 20), and parainfluenza virus (PIV) (11%; n = 14). Dual or multiple viral infections were found in 23 cases (18%). The three most prominent symptoms of the cohort were fever (78%; n = 201), tachypnoea (77%; n = 200), and runny nose (61%; n = 158). The majority had bronchiolitis (39%; n = 101) while 37% (n = 96) had pneumonia.

It was declared by the WHO as a public health emergency. The most susceptible populations, needing mechanical ventilation, are the elderly and people with associated comorbidities. There is an important risk of contagion for anesthetists, dentists, head and neck surgeons, maxillofacial surgeons, ophthalmologists, and otolaryngologists. Health workers represent between 3.8% and 20% of the infected population; some 15% will develop severe complaints and among them, many will lose their lives. A large number of patients do not have overt signs and symptoms (fever/respiratory), yet pose a real risk to surgeons (who should know this fact and must therefore apply respiratory protective strategies for all patients they encounter). All interventions that have the potential to aerosolize aerodigestive secretions should be avoided or used only when mandatory. Health workers who are: pregnant, over 55 to 65 years of age, with a history of chronic diseases (uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and all clinical scenarios where immunosuppression is feasible, including that induced to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and organ transplants) should avoid the clinical attention of a potentially infected patient. Health care facilities should prioritize urgent and emergency visits and procedures until the present condition stabilizes; truly elective care should cease and discussed on a case‐by‐case basis for patients with cancer.

For any care or intervention in the upper aerodigestive tract region, irrespective of the setting and a confirmed diagnosis (eg, rhinoscopy or flexible laryngoscopy in the outpatient setting and tracheostomy or rigid endoscopy under anesthesia), it is strongly recommended that all health care personnel wear personal protective equipment such as N95, gown, cap, eye protection, and gloves.

METHODS: This retrospective observation study is comprised of seven patients who presented with MEWDS in a 3-month period in central Israel. Data were collected from patients' medical records on clinical, multimodal imaging, and viral serology findings. RESULTS: Six women and one man of mean age 31.5 ± 7.2 years. Three reported a precedent viral infection. All had unilateral decreased vision. Funduscopy revealed foveal granularity. MAIN IMAGING FINDINGS: Hyperfluorescent spots on blue autofluorescence (BAF), hypofluorescent spots on indocyanine green angiography, dark lesions on infrared photos, and ellipsoid zone irregularities on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Resolution of the spots on BAF correlated with anatomic (SD-OCT) and visual recovery. OCT angiography performed following the convalescence stage demonstrated intact retinal and choroidal flow. Serologic findings were inconclusive. CONCLUSION: We report a unique cluster of MEWDS patients presented in a short period of time. SD-OCT findings of ellipsoid zone disruption in combination with other multimodal imaging modalities are outlined meticulously. Recognizing these imaging features along with high index of clinical suspicion is important for the diagnosis of MEWDS.

However, in China, the general public displayed more psychological problems than the front-line workers during the pandemic. Therefore, we investigated the influence of perceived stress on the sleep quality of the non-diseased general public and developed a moderated mediation model to explain said relationship. METHODS: Questionnaire-based surveys were conducted online from February 18–25, 2020 with 1,630 Chinese participants (aged 18–68 years). RESULTS: Around one-third (36.38%) of participants were poor sleepers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, higher perceived stress was significantly associated with higher anxiety levels, which, in turn, was associated with lower sleep quality. Self-esteem moderated the indirect effect of perceived stress on sleep quality through its moderation of the effect of perceived stress on anxiety. This indicated that the mediation effect of anxiety was stronger in those with low levels of self-esteem than in those with high levels of self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that both the sleep quality and perceived stress levels of the non-diseased general public required attention during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We conduct the first comparative host–pathogen coevolutionary analyses of bacterial pathogens in these hosts, using Bartonella spp. and Leptospira spp. as a model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used published genetic data for 51 Bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella from 38 rodents, and 26 Leptospira from 20 bats. We generated maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies for hosts and bacteria, and tested for coevoutionary congruence using programs ParaFit, PACO, and Jane. Bartonella spp. and their bat hosts had a significant coevolutionary fit (ParaFitGlobal = 1.9703, P≤0.001; m(2) global value = 7.3320, P≤0.0001). Bartonella spp. and rodent hosts also indicated strong overall patterns of cospeciation (ParaFitGlobal = 102.4409, P≤0.001; m(2) global value = 86.532, P≤0.0001). In contrast, we were unable to reject independence of speciation events in Leptospira and bats (ParaFitGlobal = 0.0042, P = 0.84; m(2) global value = 4.6310, P = 0.5629). Separate analyses of New World and Old World data subsets yielded results congruent with analysis from entire datasets. We also conducted event-based cophylogeny analyses to reconstruct likely evolutionary histories for each group of pathogens and hosts. Leptospira and bats had the greatest number of host switches per parasite (0.731), while Bartonella and rodents had the fewest (0.264). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In both bat and rodent hosts, Bartonella exhibits significant coevolution with minimal host switching, while Leptospira in bats lacks evolutionary congruence with its host and has high number of host switches. Reasons underlying these variable coevolutionary patterns in host range are likely due to differences in disease-specific transmission and host ecology. Understanding the coevolutionary patterns and frequency of host-switching events between bacterial pathogens and their hosts will allow better prediction of spillover between mammal reservoirs, and ultimately to humans.",2014-03-20,"Lei, Bonnie R.; Olival, Kevin J.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/638c36249e56a71ae71edd5391b1ca7fafd82daf.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3961187.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651646/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002738,9435035

Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with drugs that provide cardiovascular stability and are rapidly metabolised could be of benefit for use in rabbits. The aim was to evaluate cardiorespiratory effects of TIVA with sufentanil-midazolam in eight New Zealand White rabbits. Subcutaneous premedication with medetomidine (0.1 mg/kg BW) was followed by IV administration of a mixture of 2.5 μg/mL sufentanil and 0.45 mg/mL midazolam at a rate of 0.3 mL/kg BW/h for anaesthetic induction. Additionally, intravenous boluses of 0.1 mL of the mixture were administered every 20 s until the righting reflex was lost. Following endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained for 60 min with an infusion rate adjusted to supress the pedal withdrawal reflex. Air and oxygen (1:2) were delivered at 3 L/min. Physiological variables were recorded before induction and at predefined time points during and after anaesthesia. RESULTS: Righting and pedal withdrawal reflexes were lost within 3 and 5 min, respectively. Doses of sufentanil and midazolam were 0.48 μg/kg BW and 0.09 mg/kg BW for induction, and 0.72 μg/kg BW/h and 0.13 mg/kg BW/h for maintenance. Apnoea occurred in two rabbits. Induction of anaesthesia caused a significant increase in heart rate, cardiac output and arterial CO(2) partial pressure and a decrease in mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate and pH. Mean time from stopping the infusion to endotracheal extubation was 5 min, and to return of the righting reflex 7 min. Anaesthesia was characterized by induction and recovery without excitation, with muscle relaxation, and absence of the pedal withdrawal reflex. CONCLUSIONS: TIVA with sufentanil-midazolam provided smooth induction and recovery of anaesthesia in rabbits but with marked hypotension and respiratory depression, requiring mechanical ventilation.

Frequent mutations in the viral genome result in viruses with immune escape mutants. Irrespective of regular vaccination, control of PRRSV remains a challenge to swine farmers. In PRRSV-infected pigs, innate cytokine IFN-α is inhibited and the adaptive arm of the immunity is delayed. To elucidate both cellular and innate cytokine responses at very early stages of PRRSV infection, seven weeks old pigs maintained on a commercial pig farm were infected and analyzed. RESULTS: One pig in a pen containing 25 pigs was PRRSV infected and responses from this pig and one penmate were assessed two days later. All the infected and a few of the contact neighbor pigs were viremic. At day 2 post-infection, approximately 50% of viremic pigs had greater than 50% reduction in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and nearly a 1-fold increase in IFN-α production was detected in blood of a few pigs. Enhanced secretion of IL-4 (in ~90%), IL-12 (in ~40%), and IL-10 (in ~20%) (but not IFN-γ) in PRRSV infected pigs was observed. In addition, reduced frequency of myeloid cells, CD4(-)CD8(+ )T cells, and CD4(+)CD8(+ )T cells and upregulated frequency of lymphocytes bearing natural T regulatory cell phenotype were detected in viremic pigs. Interestingly, all viremic contact pigs also had comparable immune cell modulations. CONCLUSION: Replicating PRRSV in both infected and contact pigs was found to be responsible for rapid modulation in NK cell-meditated cytotoxicity and alteration in the production of important immune cytokines. PRRSV-induced immunological changes observed simultaneously at both cellular and cytokine levels early post-infection appear to be responsible for the delay in generation of adaptive immunity. As the study was performed in pigs maintained under commercial environmental conditions, this study has practical implications in design of protective vaccines.",2012-02-16,"Dwivedi, Varun; Manickam, Cordelia; Binjawadagi, Basavaraj; Linhares, Daniel; Murtaugh, Michael P; Renukaradhya, Gourapura J",Virol J,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/9151f784207180e12703758211d31c6d0ee84423.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3298799.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-45; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22340040/,14907196

In addition to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), other viruses have been increasingly implicated. Guidance on testing has also changed. Aims To compare clinicopathological outcomes in young children admitted with bronchiolitis due to RSV in comparison with rhinovirus (RV), and identify associated risk/epidemiological factors. Methods Children aged less than two years admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis with positive results for either RSV or RV were included in this study. Polymerase-chain-reaction-negative cases using an extended respiratory virus panel served as a control group. Retrospective data were collected on sex, risk factors, respiratory support, intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Outcomes such as length of stay (LOS) and need for transfer to the high-dependency unit/paediatric intensive care unit were included. Findings Two hundred and twenty-seven out of 437 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were positive for either RSV (N = 162) or RV (N = 65). The median age of cases was three months and 75% had at least one risk factor. Risk factors were higher in the RV group (P = 0.004). RV accounted for the majority of cases outside the RSV season (P < 0.01). RV-associated bronchiolitis had a longer LOS (more than seven days) (P < 0.05) and increased need for chest X-rays and/or antibiotics (P < 0.05). Use of intravenous fluids and respiratory support were higher in the RV group, but the difference was not significant. Conclusions RV is the second most common pathogen associated with bronchiolitis and is isolated all year round. This may be important in those with risk factors resulting in prolonged LOS. Further research is necessary to establish the exact role of RV in this common condition, particularly outside the traditional RSV season.",2017-08-31,"Paul, S.

The rabies virus (RABV) is able to infect almost all mammals and is therefore a useful model for the study of host shift mechanisms. Carnivore RABVs originated from two historical host shifts from bat viruses. To reveal the genetic pathways by which bat RABVs changed their host tropism from bats to carnivores, we investigated the second permanent bat-to-carnivore shift resulting in two carnivore variants, known as raccoon RABV (RRV) and south-central skunk RABV (SCSKV). We found that their glycoprotein (G) genes are the result of recombination between an American bat virus and a carnivore virus. This recombination allowed the bat RABV to acquire the head of the G-protein ectodomain of the carnivore virus. This region is involved in receptor recognition and binding, response to changes in the pH microenvironment, trimerization of G proteins, and cell-to-cell transmission during the viral infection. Therefore, this recombination event may have significantly improved the variant’s adaptability to carnivores, altering its host tropism and thus leading to large-scale epidemics in striped skunk and raccoon.",2017-03-21,"Ding, Nai-Zheng; Xu, Dong-Shuai; Sun, Yuan-Yuan; He, Hong-Bin; He, Cheng-Qiang",Sci Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/8c71f856263c447ba7983e1f7087259008ca8505.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5428239.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28325933/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-00395-2,3296352

Systems biology-based approaches study infectious diseases by analyzing the interactions between the host species and the pathogen organisms. This work aims to combine the knowledge from experimental studies of host–pathogen interactions in several diseases to build stronger predictive models. Our approach is based on a formalism from machine learning called ‘multitask learning’, which considers the problem of building models across tasks that are related to each other. A ‘task’ in our scenario is the set of host–pathogen protein interactions involved in one disease. To integrate interactions from several tasks (i.e. diseases), our method exploits the similarity in the infection process across the diseases. In particular, we use the biological hypothesis that similar pathogens target the same critical biological processes in the host, in defining a common structure across the tasks. Results: Our current work on host–pathogen protein interaction prediction focuses on human as the host, and four bacterial species as pathogens. The multitask learning technique we develop uses a task-based regularization approach. We find that the resulting optimization problem is a difference of convex (DC) functions. To optimize, we implement a Convex–Concave procedure-based algorithm. We compare our integrative approach to baseline methods that build models on a single host–pathogen protein interaction dataset. Our results show that our approach outperforms the baselines on the training data. We further analyze the protein interaction predictions generated by the models, and find some interesting insights.

Modern plasma product production technology remains largely based on the ethanol fractionation process, but much has evolved in the last few years to improve product purity, to enhance the recovery of immunoglobulin G, and to isolate new plasma proteins, such as α1-protease inhibitor, von Willebrand factor, and protein C. Because of the human origin of the starting material and the pooling of 10 000 to 50 000 donations required for industrial processing, the major risk associated to plasma products is the transmission of blood-borne infectious agents.

The RNA viral genome encodes for a polyprotein that is co-translationally processed into three structural proteins and seven non-structural proteins. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional viral protein actively secreted in vertebrate and mosquito cells during DENV infection. In mosquito cells, NS1 is secreted in a caveolin-1 (CAV-1) dependent manner by an unconventional pathway. The caveolin chaperone complex (CCC) is a cytoplasmic complex formed by caveolin-1 and the chaperones FKBP52, Cy40 and CyA which is responsible for cholesterol traffic inside the cell. In this work, we demonstrate that in infected mosquito cells, DENV NS1 is secreted by an early and unconventional route that bypasses the Golgi apparatus in close association with the CCC. Treatment of mosquito cells with classic secretion inhibitors such as brefeldin A, golgicide A and Fli-06 showed no effect on NS1 secretion, but significant reductions in recombinant luciferase secretion and virion release. Silencing the expression of CAV1, FKBP52 with siRNAs or the inhibition of CyA by cyclosporine A resulted in significant decrease in NS1 secretion without affecting virion release. Using co-localization, co-inmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, NS1 was found to co-localize and interact with all the protein components of the CCC in mosquito infected cells. In addition, CAV-1 and FKBP52 expression was found augmented in DENV infected cells. Finally, the treatment of ZIKV infected mosquito cells with brefeldin A and golgicide A showed no effect on NS1 secretion, while affecting virion release. ZIKV NS1 was also found to co-localize with CAV-1 in infected mosquito cells. These results suggest that in mosquito cells, ZIKV NS1 follows the same secretory pathway observed for DENV NS1. The association of NS1 with the cholesterol transporter CCC agrees with the lipoprotein nature of secreted hexameric NS1. AUTHOR SUMMARY Dengue protein NS1 is secreted in infected mosquito and vertebrate cells. In humans, secreted NS1 have been associated with pathogenesis. In mosquito cells, NS1 follows an unconventional secretion pathway that is dependent on Caveolin-1. This work shows that in mosquito cells, NS1 secretion is associated to the chaperone caveolin complex, a complex formed by caveolin-1 and several chaperones, in charge of cholesterol transport within the cells. Reduction of the expression or the activity of chaperone caveolin complex in mosquito infected cells, diminished the secretion of NS1 without affecting virion release. Direct interaction between NS1 and the chaperone caveolin complex proteins was demonstrated by several assays. Moreover, increased expression of the caveolin-1 and co-chaperone FKBP52 during dengue infection was found, presumably in response to the higher requirements of these proteins during dengue virus infection. Results obtained with ZIKV infected mosquito cells suggest that also ZIKV NS1 is released following an unconventional secretory route in association with the chaperone caveolin complex. The functions of secreted NS1 within mosquito are unclear. However, giving the importance of the soluble NS1 in the vertebrate host, manipulation of the NS1 secretory route may prove a valuable strategy for dengue mosquito control and patient treatment.",2018-07-17,"Ramirez, Romel Rosales; Ludert, Juan E.",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/500c5ea0961b573ba5355d364ca94c00a0a26e4a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/deff731c9ab79995d16c839ae35d771d49af62f9.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/370932,196672199

It is characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, severe cytopenia, serious liver dysfunction, coagulopathy and neurologic involvement. The principal treatment for patients with this syndrome includes etoposide 150 mg/2 M twice a week for two weeks, dexamethasone 10 mg/2 M for two weeks and cyclosporine 3 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg for a longer period. Cases of relapse of macrophage activating syndrome are relatively rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 15-year-old Iraqi girl with Still's disease who developed macrophage activating syndrome with acute respiratory distress syndrome that required resuscitation and mechanical ventilation. Following intensive treatment, including high dose steroids and cyclosporine, the patient improved significantly. Two weeks after cyclosporine was discontinued, however, she was readmitted with an acute relapse of macrophage activating syndrome manifested by spiking fever, arthralgias, maculopapular rash and leukocytosis. This time the patient recovered following the reintroduction of treatment with cyclosporine and the addition of mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept). CONCLUSION: We believe that cyclosporine is a cornerstone for the treatment of Still's disease.

To combat against this pathogen, immune cells release cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which is pivotal in the development of protective granulomas. Our previous results showed that Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), a mycobacterium used as a model to investigate the immune response against MTB, stimulates the induction of TNF-α via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in human blood monocytes. Since MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) is known to regulate MAPK activities, we examined whether MKP-1 plays a role in BCG-induced MAPK activation and cytokine expression. RESULTS: Primary human blood monocytes were treated with BCG and assayed for MKP-1 expression. Our results demonstrated that following exposure to BCG, there was an increase in the expression of MKP-1. Additionally, the induction of MKP-1 was regulated by p38 MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Surprisingly, when MKP-1 expression was blocked by its specific siRNA, there was a significant decrease in the levels of phospho-MAPK (p38 MAPK and ERK1/2) and TNF-α inducible by BCG.

Different laboratories have hypothesized that cholesterol efflux can influence the extent and/or movement of lipid raft microdomains. In a previous study, our laboratory investigated the identity of sperm proteins putatively associated with rafts. After extraction with Triton X-100 and ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients, proteins distributing to the light buoyant-density fractions were cored from polyacrylamide gels and microsequenced. In this study, a subset of these proteins (TEX101, basigin, hexokinase 1, facilitated glucose transporter 3, IZUMO, and SPAM1) and other molecules known to be enriched in membrane rafts (caveolin 2, flotillin 1, flotillin 2, and the ganglioside GM3) were selected to investigate their localization in the sperm and their behavior during capacitation and the acrosome reaction. These molecules localize to multiple sperm domains, including the acrosomal cap (IZUMO, caveolin 2, and flotillin 2), equatorial segment (GM3), cytoplasmic droplet (TEX101), midpiece (basigin, facilitated glucose transporter 3, and flotillin 2), and principal piece (facilitated glucose transporter 3). Some of these markers modified their immunofluorescence pattern after sperm incubation under capacitating conditions, and these changes correlated with the occurrence of the acrosome reaction. While GM3 and caveolin 2 were not detected after the acrosome reaction, flotillin 2 was found in the equatorial segment of acrosome-reacted sperm, and IZUMO distributed along the sperm head, reaching the post- and para-acrosomal areas. Taking into consideration the requirement of the acrosome reaction for sperm to become fusogenic, these results suggest that membrane raft dynamics may have a role in sperm-egg membrane interaction.",2009-05-01,"Miranda, Patricia V.; Allaire, Alicia; Sosnik, Julian; Visconti, Pablo E.",Biology of Reproduction,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3cbc71c13d33818568327dbe07aba209549aea2a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2804839.xml.json,https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article-pdf/80/5/897/10571849/biolreprod0897.pdf,

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We immortalized IgG(+) memory B cells from individuals infected with diverse clades of HIV-1 and selected on the basis of plasma neutralization profiles that were cross-clade and relatively potent. Culture supernatants were screened using various recombinant forms of the envelope glycoproteins (Env) in multiple parallel assays. We isolated 58 mAbs that were mapped to different Env surfaces, most of which showed neutralizing activity. One mAb in particular (HJ16) specific for a novel epitope proximal to the CD4 binding site on gp120 selectively neutralized a multi-clade panel of Tier-2 HIV-1 pseudoviruses, and demonstrated reactivity that was comparable in breadth, but distinct in neutralization specificity, to that of the other CD4 binding site-specific neutralizing mAb b12. A second mAb (HGN194) bound a conserved epitope in the V3 crown and neutralized all Tier-1 and a proportion of Tier-2 pseudoviruses tested, irrespective of clade. A third mAb (HK20) with broad neutralizing activity, particularly as a Fab fragment, recognized a highly conserved epitope in the HR-1 region of gp41, but showed striking assay-dependent selectivity in its activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that by using appropriate screening methods, a large proportion of memory B cells can be isolated that produce mAbs with HIV-1 neutralizing activity.

However, the possibility of within-flight transmission of H1N1 has not been evaluated; although it is known that smallpox, measles, tuberculosis, SARS and seasonal influenza can be transmitted during commercial flights. Here we present the first quantitative risk assessment to assess the potential for within-flight transmission of H1N1. METHODS: We model airborne transmission of infectious viral particles of H1N1 within a Boeing 747 using methodology from the field of quantitative microbial risk assessment. RESULTS: The risk of catching H1N1 will essentially be confined to passengers travelling in the same cabin as the source case. Not surprisingly, we find that the longer the flight the greater the number of infections that can be expected. We calculate that H1N1, even during long flights, poses a low to moderate within-flight transmission risk if the source case travels First Class. Specifically, 0-1 infections could occur during a 5 hour flight, 1-3 during an 11 hour flight and 2-5 during a 17 hour flight. However, within-flight transmission could be significant, particularly during long flights, if the source case travels in Economy Class. Specifically, two to five infections could occur during a 5 hour flight, 5-10 during an 11 hour flight and 7-17 during a 17 hour flight. If the aircraft is only partially loaded, under certain conditions more infections could occur in First Class than in Economy Class. During a 17 hour flight, a greater number of infections would occur in First Class than in Economy if the First Class Cabin is fully occupied, but Economy class is less than 30% full. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide insights into the potential utility of air travel restrictions on controlling influenza pandemics in the winter of 2009/2010. They show travel by one infectious individual, rather than causing a single outbreak of H1N1, could cause several simultaneous outbreaks.

Herein, we show that IPS-1, the central adaptor protein to RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling, is essential for triggering of innate immunity and for effective development and regulation of adaptive immunity against pathogenic WNV. IPS-1(−/−) mice exhibited increased susceptibility to WNV infection marked by enhanced viral replication and dissemination with early viral entry into the CNS. Infection of cultured bone-marrow (BM) derived dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages (Macs), and primary cortical neurons showed that the IPS-1-dependent RLR signaling was essential for triggering IFN defenses and controlling virus replication in these key target cells of infection. Intriguingly, infected IPS-1(−/−) mice displayed uncontrolled inflammation that included elevated systemic type I IFN, proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses, increased numbers of inflammatory DCs, enhanced humoral responses marked by complete loss of virus neutralization activity, and increased numbers of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and non-specific immune cell proliferation in the periphery and in the CNS. This uncontrolled inflammatory response was associated with a lack of regulatory T cell expansion that normally occurs during acute WNV infection. Thus, the enhanced inflammatory response in the absence of IPS-1 was coupled with a failure to protect against WNV infection. Our data define an innate/adaptive immune interface mediated through IPS-1-dependent RLR signaling that regulates the quantity, quality, and balance of the immune response to WNV infection.",2010-02-05,"Suthar, Mehul S.; Ma, Daphne Y.; Thomas, Sunil; Lund, Jennifer M.; Zhang, Nu; Daffis, Stephane; Rudensky, Alexander Y.; Bevan, Michael J.; Clark, Edward A.; Kaja, Murali-Krishna; Diamond, Michael S.; Gale, Michael",PLoS Pathog,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/513d5ea4db4eb8e94c14c46b018c6041d78119cf.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2816698.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2816698/,

For the first time, post-mortem findings from a fatal case of knowlesi malaria are reported here. CASE PRESENTATION: A formerly healthy 40 year-old male became symptomatic 10 days after spending time in the jungle of North Borneo. Four days later, he presented to hospital in a state of collapse and died within two hours. He was hyponatraemic and had elevated blood urea, potassium, lactate dehydrogenase and amino transferase values; he was also thrombocytopenic and eosinophilic. Dengue haemorrhagic shock was suspected and a post-mortem examination performed. Investigations for dengue virus were negative. Blood for malaria parasites indicated hyperparasitaemia and single species P. knowlesi infection was confirmed by nested-PCR. Macroscopic pathology of the brain and endocardium showed multiple petechial haemorrhages, the liver and spleen were enlarged and lungs had features consistent with ARDS. Microscopic pathology showed sequestration of pigmented parasitized red blood cells in the vessels of the cerebrum, cerebellum, heart and kidney without evidence of chronic inflammatory reaction in the brain or any other organ examined. Brain sections were negative for intracellular adhesion molecule-1. The spleen and liver had abundant pigment containing macrophages and parasitized red blood cells. The kidney had evidence of acute tubular necrosis and endothelial cells in heart sections were prominent. CONCLUSIONS: The overall picture in this case was one of systemic malaria infection that fit the WHO classification for severe malaria. Post-mortem findings in this case were unexpectedly similar to those that define fatal falciparum malaria, including cerebral pathology. There were important differences including the absence of coma despite petechial haemorrhages and parasite sequestration in the brain. These results suggest that further study of knowlesi malaria will aid the interpretation of, often conflicting, information on malaria pathophysiology in humans.",2010-01-11,"Cox-Singh, Janet; Hiu, Jessie; Lucas, Sebastian B; Divis, Paul C; Zulkarnaen, Mohammad; Chandran, Patricia; Wong, Kum T; Adem, Patricia; Zaki, Sherif R; Singh, Balbir; Krishna, Sanjeev",Malar J,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/bf1d95ada5ce959db1a171eba72b349366a6748b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2818646.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818646/,

With limited supplies of antivirals and vaccines, countries and individuals are looking at other ways to reduce the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, particularly options that are cost effective and relatively easy to implement. Recent experiences with the 2003 SARS and 2009 H1N1 epidemics have shown that people are willing to wear facemasks to protect themselves against infection; however, little research has been done to quantify the impact of using facemasks in reducing the spread of disease. We construct and analyze a mathematical model for a population in which some people wear facemasks during the pandemic and quantify impact of these masks on the spread of influenza. To estimate the parameter values used for the effectiveness of facemasks, we used available data from studies on N95 respirators and surgical facemasks. The results show that if N95 respirators are only 20% effective in reducing susceptibility and infectivity, only 10% of the population would have to wear them to reduce the number of influenza A (H1N1) cases by 20%. We can conclude from our model that, if worn properly, facemasks are an effective intervention strategy in reducing the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009.",2010-02-10,"Tracht, Samantha M.; Del Valle, Sara Y.; Hyman, James M.",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b0a17b1f4447f0a81d2e93f2e23720feadee96cd.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2818714.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818714/,

Thailand was massively infected in 2004 and 2005 and continues today to experience sporadic outbreaks. While research findings suggest that the spread of HPAI H5N1 is influenced primarily by trade patterns, identifying the anthropogenic risk factors involved remains a challenge. In this study, we investigated which anthropogenic factors played a role in the risk of HPAI in Thailand using outbreak data from the “second wave” of the epidemic (3 July 2004 to 5 May 2005) in the country. We first performed a spatial analysis of the relative risk of HPAI H5N1 at the subdistrict level based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. We observed a strong spatial heterogeneity of the relative risk. We then tested a set of potential risk factors in a multivariable linear model. The results confirmed the role of free-grazing ducks and rice-cropping intensity but showed a weak association with fighting cock density. The results also revealed a set of anthropogenic factors significantly linked with the risk of HPAI. High risk was associated strongly with densely populated areas, short distances to a highway junction, and short distances to large cities. These findings highlight a new explanatory pattern for the risk of HPAI and indicate that, in addition to agro-environmental factors, anthropogenic factors play an important role in the spread of H5N1.

However, some countries still restrict the entrance and/or residency of foreigners with an HIV infection. HIV-related travel restrictions have serious implications for individual and public health, and violate internationally recognized human rights. In this study, we reviewed the current situation regarding HIV-related travel restrictions in the 53 countries of the WHO European Region. METHODS: We retrieved the country-specific information chiefly from the Global Database on HIV Related Travel Restrictions at hivtravel.org. We simplified and standardized the database information to enable us to create an overview and compare countries. Where data was outdated, unclear or contradictory, we contacted WHO HIV focal points in the countries or appropriate non-governmental organizations. The United States Bureau of Consular Affairs website was also used to confirm and complement these data. RESULTS: Our review revealed that there are no entry restrictions for people living with HIV in 51 countries in the WHO European Region. In 11 countries, foreigners living with HIV applying for long-term stays will not be granted a visa. These countries are: Andorra, Armenia, Cyprus (denies access for non-European Union citizens), Hungary, Kazakhstan, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. In Uzbekistan, an HIV-positive foreigner cannot even enter the country, and in Georgia, we were not able to determine whether there were any HIV-related travel restrictions due to a lack of information. CONCLUSIONS: In 32% of the countries in the European Region, either there are some kind of HIV-related travel restrictions or we were unable to determine if such restrictions are in force. Most of these countries defend restrictions as being justified by public health concerns. However, there is no evidence that denying HIV-positive foreigners access to a country is effective in protecting public health.

Widespread resistance to both classes of influenza antivirals (adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors) occurs in both pandemic and seasonal viruses, rendering these drugs to be of marginal utility in the treatment modality. Worldwide, virtually all 2009 H1N1 and seasonal H3N2 strains are resistant to the adamantanes (rimantadine and amantadine), and the majority of seasonal H1N1 strains are resistant to oseltamivir, the most widely prescribed neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI). To address the need for more effective therapy, we evaluated the in vitro activity of a triple combination antiviral drug (TCAD) regimen composed of drugs with different mechanisms of action against drug-resistant seasonal and 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses. Amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir, alone and in combination, were tested against amantadine- and oseltamivir-resistant influenza A viruses using an in vitro infection model in MDCK cells. Our data show that the triple combination was highly synergistic against drug-resistant viruses, and the synergy of the triple combination was significantly greater than the synergy of any double combination tested (P<0.05), including the combination of two NAIs. Surprisingly, amantadine and oseltamivir contributed to the antiviral activity of the TCAD regimen against amantadine- and oseltamivir-resistant viruses, respectively, at concentrations where they had no activity as single agents, and at concentrations that were clinically achievable. Our data demonstrate that the TCAD regimen composed of amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir is highly synergistic against resistant viruses, including 2009 H1N1.

This condition is associated with lymphadenopathy, polyclonal gammopathy, hepato-splenomegaly and systemic symptoms. A number of small studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, in treating this condition. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 46 year old Zambian woman who presented with pyrexia, diarrhoea and vomiting, confusion, lymphadenopathy, and renal failure. She rapidly developed multiple organ failure following the initiation of treatment of MCD with rituximab. Following admission to intensive care (ICU), she received prompt multi-organ support. After 21 days on the ICU she returned to the haematology medical ward, and was discharged in remission from her disease after 149 days in hospital. CONCLUSION: Rituximab, the efficacy of which has thus far been examined predominantly in patients outside the ICU, in conjunction with extensive organ support was effective treatment for MCD with associated multiple organ failure. There is, to our knowledge, only one other published report of its successful use in an ICU setting, where it was combined with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and prednisolone. Reports such as ours support the notion that critically unwell patients with HIV and haematological disease can benefit from intensive care.",2010-01-30,"Johns, Robin H; Doyle, Tomas; Lipman, Marc C; Cwynarski, Kate; Cleverley, Joanne R; Isaacson, Peter G; Shaw, Steve; Agarwal, Banwari",J Med Case Reports,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/5709e6d04771fd3207126fee6de4e7b607b6f21d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2825517.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2825517/,

These sequences are highly conserved among different serotype viruses based on sequence analysis. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-expressing plasmids (p3D-NT19, p3D-NT56, pVP4-NT19, pVP4-NT65 and p2B-NT25) were constructed to express siRNA targeting 3D, VP4 and 2B, respectively. The antiviral potential of these siRNA for various FMDV isolates was investigated in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells and suckling mice. The results show that these siRNA inhibited virus yield 10- to 300-fold for different FMDV isolates of serotype O and serotype Asia I at 48 h post infection in BHK-21 cells compared to control cells. In suckling mice, p3D-NT56 and p2B-NT25 delayed the death of mice. Twenty percent to 40% of the animals that received a single siRNA dose survived 5 days post infection with serotype O or serotype Asia I. We used an attenuated Salmonella choleraesuis (C500) vaccine strain, to carry the plasmid that expresses siRNA directed against the polymerase gene 3D (p3D-NT56) of FMDV. We used guinea pigs to evaluate the inhibitory effects of recombinant S. cho (p3D-NT56/S. cho) on FMDV infection. The results show that 80% of guinea pigs inoculated with 10(9) CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho and challenged 36 h later with 50 ID(50) of homologous FMDV were protected. We also measured the antiviral activity of p3D-NT56/S. cho in swine.

Virus particles lacking gB, gD, gH or gL are entry-defective, although these viruses retain the ability to bind to the plasma membrane via the remaining glycoproteins. Soluble forms of gD have been shown to trigger the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB transcriptional complex in addition to stimulating the production of Type I interferon. By taking advantage of the entry-defective phenotype of glycoprotein-deficient HSV-1 virus particles, the results presented here show that binding of virions to cellular receptors on the plasma membrane is sufficient to stimulate a change in cellular gene expression. Preliminary microarray studies, validated by quantitative real-time PCR, identified the differential expression of cellular genes associated with the NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, Jak/Stat and related Jak/Src pathways by virions lacking gB or gH but not gD. Gene induction occurred at a few particles per cell, corresponding to physiological conditions during primary infection. Reporter assay studies determined that NF-κB transcriptional activity is stimulated within an hour of HSV-1 binding, peaks between two and three hours post-binding and declines to background levels by five hours after induction. The immediate, transient nature of these signalling events suggests that HSV-1 glycoproteins, particularly gD, may alter the cellular environment pre-entry so as to condition the cell for viral replication.",2010-03-05,"MacLeod, Iain J.; Minson, Tony",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f72764a9a0f911eb892cf04752566d6ef4ee54c4.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2832691.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2832691/,

We aimed to compare the risk of influenza infection in healthcare workers in acute hospital care with that in non-healthcare workers over the same season. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicentre cohort study during the 2006/07 influenza season in Berlin, Germany. Recruited participants gave serum samples before and after the season, and completed questionnaires to determine their relevant exposures and possible confounding factors. The main outcome measure was serologically confirmed influenza infection (SCII), defined as a fourfold or greater rise in haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres to a circulating strain of influenza (with post-season titre at least 1:40). Weekly mobile phone text messages were used to prompt participants to report respiratory illnesses during the influenza season. A logistic regression model was used to assess the influence of potential risk factors. RESULTS: We recruited 250 hospital healthcare workers (mean age 35.7 years) and 486 non-healthcare workers (mean age 39.2 years) from administrative centres, blood donors and colleges. Overall SCII attack rate was 10.6%. Being a healthcare worker was not a risk factor for SCII (relative risk 1.1, p = 0.70). The final multivariate model had three significant factors: living with children (odds ratio [OR] 3.7, p = 0.005), immunization (OR 0.50, p = 0.02), and - among persons living in households without children - ownership of a car (OR 3.0, p = 0.02). Living with three or more children (OR 13.8, p < 0.01) was a greater risk than living with one or two children (OR 5.3, p = 0.02). 30% of participants with SCII reported no respiratory illness. Healthcare workers were at slightly higher risk of reporting any respiratory infection than controls (adjusted OR 1.3, p = 0.04, n = 850). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that healthcare workers in hospitals do not have a higher risk of influenza than non-healthcare workers, although their risk of any respiratory infection is slightly raised. Household contacts seem to be more important than exposure to patients. Car ownership is a surprise finding which needs further exploration.

It is both time-consuming and costly to determine compound-protein interactions or potential drug-target interactions by experiments alone. As a complement, the in silico prediction methods can provide us with very useful information in a timely manner. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To realize this, drug compounds are encoded with functional groups and proteins encoded by biological features including biochemical and physicochemical properties. The optimal feature selection procedures are adopted by means of the mRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) method. Instead of classifying the proteins as a whole family, target proteins are divided into four groups: enzymes, ion channels, G-protein- coupled receptors and nuclear receptors. Thus, four independent predictors are established using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm as their operation engine, with each to predict the interactions between drugs and one of the four protein groups. As a result, the overall success rates by the jackknife cross-validation tests achieved with the four predictors are 85.48%, 80.78%, 78.49%, and 85.66%, respectively.

However, a pseudoknot is not sufficient to promote −1 PRF. hTPK-DU177, a pseudoknot derived from human telomerase RNA, shares structural similarities with several −1 PRF pseudoknots and is used to dissect the roles of distinct structural features in the stimulator of −1 PRF. Structure-based mutagenesis on hTPK-DU177 reveals that the −1 PRF efficiency of this stimulator can be modulated by sequential removal of base–triple interactions surrounding the helical junction. Further analysis of the junction-flanking base triples indicates that specific stem–loop interactions and their relative positions to the helical junction play crucial roles for the −1 PRF activity of this pseudoknot. Intriguingly, a bimolecular pseudoknot approach based on hTPK-DU177 reveals that continuing triplex structure spanning the helical junction, lacking one of the loop-closure features embedded in pseudoknot topology, can stimulate −1 PRF. Therefore, the triplex structure is an essential determinant for the DU177 pseudoknot to stimulate −1 PRF.

There was a limited record of waterborne viral disease outbreaks at the time; recorded data on foodborne outbreaks were fewer still. Laboratory environmental (water and wastewater) virology was in its infancy, and food virology was in gestation. Detection of viruses was most often attempted by inoculation of primary primate cell cultures, with observation for plaque formation or cytopathic effects. Focus was initially on enteroviruses and reoviruses. Environmental and food samples had to be liquefied if not already in liquid form; clarified to remove solids, bacteria, and fungi; and concentrated to a volume that could be tested in cell culture. Cytotoxicity was also a concern. Studies at the FRI and some other laboratories addressed all of these challenges. The FRI group was the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center for Food Virology for many years. Other topics studied were virus inactivation as functions of temperature, time, matrix, disinfectants, and microbial action; peroral and ex-vivo infectivity; and the suitability of various virus surrogates for environmental monitoring and inactivation experiments. Detection of noroviruses and hepatitis A virus required molecular methods, most often RT-PCR. When it was found that inactivated virus often gave the same RT-PCR signal as that of infectious virus, sample treatments were sought, which would prevent false-positive test results.

Animal to human transmission has been observed thrice in the last century within an average range of 11-39 years of antigenic recycling. The recent outbreak of influenza A (H1N1, also termed as swine flu), first reported in Mexico on April 26, 2009, occurred in the forty first year since last reported flu pandemic (July 1968). Within less than 50 days, it has assumed pandemic proportions (phase VI) affecting over 76 countries with 163 deaths/35,928 cases (as on 15(th) June 2009). It indicated the re-emergence of genetically reassorted virus having strains endemic to humans, swine and avian (H5N1). The World Health Organisation (WHO) member states have already pulled up their socks and geared up to combat such criticalities. Earlier outbreaks of avian flu (H5N1) in different countries led WHO to develop pandemic preparedness strategies with national/regional plans on pandemic preparedness. Numerous factors related to climatic conditions, socio-economic strata, governance and sharing of information/logistics at all levels have been considered critical indicators in monitoring the dynamics of escalation towards a pandemic situation.

Here, we investigate the relative efficacy of NP and M2 compared to HA in protecting against HPAI H5N1 virus. In mice, previous studies have shown that vaccination with NP and M2 in recombinant DNA and/or adenovirus vectors or with adjuvants confers protection against lethal challenge in the absence of HA. However, we find that the protective efficacy of NP and M2 diminishes as the virulence and dose of the challenge virus are increased. To explore this question in a model relevant to human disease, ferrets were immunized with DNA/rAd5 vaccines encoding NP, M2, HA, NP+M2 or HA+NP+M2. Only HA or HA+NP+M2 vaccination conferred protection against a stringent virus challenge. Therefore, while gene-based vaccination with NP and M2 may provide moderate levels of protection against low challenge doses, it is insufficient to confer protective immunity against high challenge doses of H5N1 in ferrets. These immunogens may require combinatorial vaccination with HA, which confers protection even against very high doses of lethal viral challenge.",2010-03-23,"Rao, Srinivas S.; Kong, Wing-Pui; Wei, Chih-Jen; Van Hoeven, Neal; Gorres, J.

Evidence that DNA vaccines are well tolerated and have an excellent safety profile proved to be of advantage as many clinical trials combines the first phase with the second, saving both time and money. It is clear from the results obtained in clinical trials that such DNA vaccines require much improvement in antigen expression and delivery methods to make them sufficiently effective in the clinic. Similarly, it is clear that additional strategies are required to activate effective immunity against poorly immunogenic tumor antigens. Engineering vaccine design for manipulating antigen presentation and processing pathways is one of the most important aspects that can be easily handled in the DNA vaccine technology. Several approaches have been investigated including DNA vaccine engineering, co-delivery of immunomodulatory molecules, safe routes of administration, prime-boost regimen and strategies to break the immunosuppressive networks mechanisms adopted by malignant cells to prevent immune cell function.

We describe a novel siRNA-based approach – synthetically linking siRNA to an oligonucleotide TLR9 agonist – that targets and silences genes in TLR9(+) myeloid cells and B cells, both of which are key components of the tumor microenvironment. Because Stat3 in tumor-associated immune cells suppresses antitumor immune responses and hinders TLR9-induced immune stimulation, we tested CpG-Stat3siRNA conjugates for anti-tumor effects. When injected locally at the tumor site or systemically through an intravenous route, the CpG-Stat3siRNA conjugates access tumor-associated dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells, inhibit Stat3 expression, leading to activation of tumor-associated immune cells, and ultimately potent anti-tumor immune responses.

RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans, while in livestock it causes fever and high abortion rates. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sequence analysis showed that a wild-type RVFV ZH501 preparation consisted of two major viral subpopulations, with a single nucleotide heterogeneity at nucleotide 847 of M segment (M847); one had a G residue at M847 encoding glycine in a major viral envelope Gn protein, while the other carried A residue encoding glutamic acid at the corresponding site. Two ZH501-derived viruses, rZH501-M847-G and rZH501-M847-A, carried identical genomic sequences, except that the former and the latter had G and A, respectively, at M847 were recovered by using a reverse genetics system. Intraperitoneal inoculation of rZH501-M847-A into mice caused a rapid and efficient viral accumulation in the sera, livers, spleens, kidneys and brains, and killed most of the mice within 8 days, whereas rZH501-M847-G caused low viremia titers, did not replicate as efficiently as did rZH501-M847-A in these organs, and had attenuated virulence to mice. Remarkably, as early as 2 days postinfection with rZH501-M847-G, the viruses carrying A at M847 emerged and became the major virus population thereafter, while replicating viruses retained the input A residue at M847 in rZH501-M847-A-infected mice.

Important consideration for the strategy includes preparation of vaccines from a currently circulating strain to induce broad-spectrum immunity toward newly emerged human H5 strains. This strategy would be a good solution early in a pandemic until an antigenically matched and approved vaccine is produced.

Human contact networks exhibit strong community structure. Understanding how such community structure affects epidemics may provide insights for preventing the spread of disease between communities by changing the structure of the contact network through pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions. We use empirical and simulated networks to investigate the spread of disease in networks with community structure. We find that community structure has a major impact on disease dynamics, and we show that in networks with strong community structure, immunization interventions targeted at individuals bridging communities are more effective than those simply targeting highly connected individuals. Because the structure of relevant contact networks is generally not known, and vaccine supply is often limited, there is great need for efficient vaccination algorithms that do not require full knowledge of the network. We developed an algorithm that acts only on locally available network information and is able to quickly identify targets for successful immunization intervention. The algorithm generally outperforms existing algorithms when vaccine supply is limited, particularly in networks with strong community structure. Understanding the spread of infectious diseases and designing optimal control strategies is a major goal of public health.

Prediction of a pseudoknotted minimum free energy structure is an NP-complete problem. Practical algorithms for RNA structure prediction including restricted classes of pseudoknots suffer from high runtime and poor accuracy for longer sequences. A heuristic approach is to search for promising pseudoknot candidates in a sequence and verify those. Afterwards, the detected pseudoknots can be further analysed using bioinformatics or laboratory techniques. We present a novel pseudoknot detection method called DotKnot that extracts stem regions from the secondary structure probability dot plot and assembles pseudoknot candidates in a constructive fashion. We evaluate pseudoknot free energies using novel parameters, which have recently become available. We show that the conventional probability dot plot makes a wide class of pseudoknots including those with bulged stems manageable in an explicit fashion. The energy parameters now become the limiting factor in pseudoknot prediction. DotKnot is an efficient method for long sequences, which finds pseudoknots with higher accuracy compared to other known prediction algorithms.

Viral diversity is high in aPMV-1; eight genotypes are recognized based on phylogenetic reconstruction of gene sequences. Modified live vaccines have been developed to decrease the economic losses caused by this virus. Vaccines derived from avirulent genotype II strains were developed in the 1950s and are in use globally, whereas Australian strains belonging to genotype I were developed as vaccines in the 1970s and are used mainly in Asia. In this study, we evaluated the consequences of attenuated live virus vaccination on the evolution of aPMV-1 genotypes. There was phylogenetic incongruence among trees based on individual genes and complete coding region of 54 full length aPMV-1 genomes, suggesting that recombinant sequences were present in the data set. Subsequently, five recombinant genomes were identified, four of which contained sequences from either genotype I or II. The population history of vaccine-related genotype II strains was distinct from other aPMV-1 genotypes; genotype II emerged in the late 19(th) century and is evolving more slowly than other genotypes, which emerged in the 1960s. Despite vaccination efforts, genotype II viruses have experienced constant population growth to the present. In contrast, other contemporary genotypes showed population declines in the late 1990s. Additionally, genotype I and II viruses, which are circulating in the presence of homotypic vaccine pressure, have unique selection profiles compared to nonvaccine-related strains. Collectively, these data show that vaccination with live attenuated viruses has changed the evolution of aPMV-1 by maintaining a large effective population size of a vaccine-related genotype, allowing for coinfection and recombination of vaccine and wild type strains, and by applying unique selective pressures on viral glycoproteins.",2010-04-22,"Chong, Yee Ling; Padhi, Abinash; Hudson, Peter J.; Poss, Mary",PLoS Pathog,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/5ca920dabf09c2c2dd2c62f8ef5917e3bd72f087.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2858710.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2858710/,

Here we have infected cells with Marburg virus under BSL-4 containment conditions, and reconstructed the sequence of steps in the budding process in three dimensions using electron tomography of plastic-embedded cells. We find that highly infectious filamentous particles are released at early stages in infection. Budding proceeds via lateral association of intracellular nucleocapsid along its whole length with the plasma membrane, followed by rapid envelopment initiated at one end of the nucleocapsid, leading to a protruding intermediate. Scission results in local membrane instability at the rear of the virus. After prolonged infection, increased vesiculation of the plasma membrane correlates with changes in shape and infectivity of released viruses. Our observations demonstrate a cellular determinant of virus shape.

During this time frame, components of the innate immune system such as macrophages and DCs, NK cells, β-defensins, complement and other anti-microbial factors, which have all been implicated in modulating HIV infection, may play particularly important roles. A proteomics-based screen was performed on a cohort from whom samples were available at time points prior to the earliest positive HIV detection. The ability of selected factors found to be elevated in the plasma during AHI to inhibit HIV-1 replication was analyzed using in vitro PBMC and DC infection models. Analysis of unique plasma donor panels spanning the eclipse and viral expansion phases revealed very early alterations in plasma proteins in AHI. Induction of acute phase protein serum amyloid A (A-SAA) occurred as early as 5–7 days prior to the first detection of plasma viral RNA, considerably prior to any elevation in systemic cytokine levels. Furthermore, a proteolytic fragment of alpha–1-antitrypsin (AAT), termed virus inhibitory peptide (VIRIP), was observed in plasma coincident with viremia. Both A-SAA and VIRIP have anti-viral activity in vitro and quantitation of their plasma levels indicated that circulating concentrations are likely to be within the range of their inhibitory activity. Our results provide evidence for a first wave of host anti-viral defense occurring in the eclipse phase of AHI prior to systemic activation of other immune responses.

Hence the two proper correlation-related distance metrics proposed here improve our dynamical language approach for phylogenetic analysis.,2010-03-18,"Yu, Zu-Guo; Zhan, Xiao-Wen; Han, Guo-Sheng; Wang, Roger W.; Anh, Vo; Chu, Ka Hou",Int J Mol Sci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ae3594fcd839554d0a4ea161dc9bbd3d1f6dbaa9.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2869232.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2869232/,

In addition, it poses a major public health threat as it can be transmitted directly from infected poultry to humans with very high (60%) mortality rate. Effective vaccination against HPAI H5N1 would protect commercial poultry and would thus provide an important control measure by reducing the likelihood of bird-to-bird and bird-to-human transmission. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study we evaluated the vaccine potential of recombinant soluble trimeric subtype 5 hemagglutinin (sH5(3)) produced in mammalian cells. The secreted, purified sH5(3) was biologically active as demonstrated by its binding to ligands in a sialic acid-dependent manner. It was shown to protect chickens, in a dose-dependent manner, against a lethal challenge with H5N1 after a single vaccination. Protected animals did not shed challenge virus as determined by a quantitative RT-PCR on RNA isolated from trachea and cloaca swabs. Also in mice, vaccination with sH5(3) provided complete protection against challenge with HPAI H5N1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that sH5(3) constitutes an attractive vaccine antigen for protection of chickens and mammals against HPAI H5N1. As these recombinant soluble hemagglutinin preparations can be produced with high yields and with relatively short lead time, they enable a rapid response to circulating and potentially pandemic influenza viruses.",2010-05-14,"Cornelissen, Lisette A.

To help clinicians triage adults with acute respiratory illness, a scoring system for influenza-like illness (ILI) was implemented at Hospital Civil de Guadalajara, Mexico. METHODS: A medical history, laboratory and radiology results were collected on emergency room (ER) patients with acute respiratory illness to calculate an ILI-score. Patients were evaluated for admission by their ILI-score and clinicians' assessment of risk for developing complications. Nasal and throat swabs were collected from intermediate and high-risk patients for influenza testing by RT-PCR. The disposition and ILI-score of those oseltamivir-treated versus untreated, clinical characteristics of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) patients versus test-negative patients were compared by Pearson's Χ(2), Fisher's Exact, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. RESULTS: Of 1840 ER patients, 230 were initially hospitalized (mean ILI-score = 15), and the rest were discharged, including 286 ambulatory patients given oseltamivir (median ILI-score = 11), and 1324 untreated (median ILI-score = 5). Fourteen (1%) untreated patients returned, and 3 were hospitalized on oseltamivir (median ILI-score = 19). Of 371 patients tested by RT-PCR, 104 (28%) had pandemic influenza and 42 (11%) had seasonal influenza A detected. Twenty (91%) of 22 imaged hospitalized pandemic influenza patients had bilateral infiltrates compared to 23 (38%) of 61 imaged hospital test-negative patients (p<0.001). One patient with confirmed pandemic influenza presented 6 days after symptom onset, required mechanical ventilation, and died.

METHODS: A compartmental model with pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic influenza infections is proposed which incorporates age groups as well as intervention measures such as age-specific vaccination, in order to study spread of influenza in a community. RESULTS: We derive the basic reproduction number and other effective reproduction numbers under various intervention measures. For illustration, we make use of the Pneumonia and Influenza (P&I) mortality data and vaccination data of the very young (age 0-2) and the very old (age >64) during 2004-2005 Taiwan winter influenza season to fit our model and to compute the relevant reproduction numbers. The reproduction number for this winter flu season is estimated to be slightly above one (~1.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Comparatively large errors in fitting the P&I mortality data of the elderly (>64) were observed shortly after winter school closings in January, which may indicate the impact of younger, more active age groups transmitting influenza to other age groups outside of the school settings; in particular, to the elderly in the households. Pre-symptomatic infections seemed to have little effect on the model fit, while asymptomatic infection by asymptomatic infectives has a more pronounced impact on the model fit for the elderly mortality, perhaps indicating a larger role in disease transmission by asymptomatic infection. Simulations indicate that the impact of vaccination on the disease incidence might not be fully revealed in the change (or the lack thereof) in the effective reproduction number with interventions, but could still be substantial. The estimated per contact transmission probability for susceptible elderly is significantly higher than that of any other age group, perhaps highlighting the vulnerability of the elderly due to close contacts with their caretakers from other age groups. The relative impact of targeting the very young and the very old for vaccination was weakened by their relative inactivity, thus giving evidence of the lack of impact of vaccinating these two groups on the overall transmissibility of the disease in the community. This further underscores the need for morbidity-based strategy to prevent elderly mortality.",2010-04-30,"Hsieh, Ying-Hen",BMC Infect Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0d3e6c56ef64eb7705fbed676eddcfa8af8ef65f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2876165.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2876165/,

Here we describe our first year experience of in-hospital ECLS activity, the operative algorithm and the protocol for centralization of adult patients from district hospitals. METHODS: At a tertiary referral trauma center (Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence, Italy), an ECLS program was developed from 2008 by the Emergency Department and Heart and Vessel Department ICUs. The ECLS team consists of an intensivist, a cardiac surgeon, a cardiologist and a perfusionist, all trained in ECLS technique. ECMO support was applied in case of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) not responsive to conventional treatments. The use of veno-arterial (V-A) ECLS for cardiac support was reserved for cases of cardiac shock refractory to standard treatment and cardiac arrests not responding to conventional resuscitation. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were treated with ECLS during the first year of activity. Among them, 13 received ECMO for ARDS (5 H1N1-virus related), with a 62% survival. In one case of post-traumatic ARDS, V-A ECLS support permitted multiple organ donation after cerebral death was confirmed. Patients treated with V-A ECLS due to cardiogenic shock (N = 4) had a survival rate of 50%. No patients on V-A ECLS support after cardiac arrest survived (N = 4).

Mitigating the spread of such an influenza pandemic would require not only the timely administration of antiviral drugs to those infected, but also the implementation of suitable intervention policies for stunting the spread of the virus. Towards this end, mathematical modelling and simulation studies are crucial as they allow us to evaluate the predicted effectiveness of the various intervention policies before enforcing them. Diagnosis plays a vital role in the overall pandemic management framework by detecting and distinguishing the pathogenic strain from the less threatening seasonal strains and other influenza-like illnesses. This allows treatment and intervention to be deployed effectively, given limited antiviral supplies and other resources. However, the time required to design a fast and accurate testkit for novel strains may limit the role of diagnosis. Herein, we aim to investigate the cost and effectiveness of different diagnostic methods using a stochastic agent-based city-scale model, and then address the issue of whether conventional testing approaches, when used with appropriate intervention policies, can be as effective as fast testkits in containing a pandemic outbreak. We found that for mitigation purposes, fast and accurate testkits are not necessary as long as sufficient medication is given, and are generally recommended only when used with extensive contact tracing and prophylaxis. Additionally, in the event of insufficient medication and fast testkits, the use of slower, conventional testkits together with proper isolation policies while waiting for the diagnostic results can be an equally effective substitute.",2010-07-06,"Chin, Juxin; Koh, Geoffrey; Lee, Dong-Yup",J R Soc Interface,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/dd4007604c49bf0a0933e4dad118b8c5073c8c7f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2880075.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2880075/,

Rotavirus-induced immune responses, especially the T and B cell responses, have been extensively characterized; however, little is known about innate immune mechanisms involved in the control of rotavirus infection. Although increased levels of systemic type I interferon (IFNα and β) correlate with accelerated resolution of rotavirus disease, multiple rotavirus strains, including rhesus rotavirus (RRV), have been demonstrated to antagonize type I IFN production in a variety of epithelial and fibroblast cell types through several mechanisms, including degradation of multiple interferon regulatory factors by a viral nonstructural protein. This report demonstrates that stimulation of highly purified primary human peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) with either live or inactivated RRV induces substantial IFNα production by a subset of pDCs in which RRV does not replicate. Characterization of pDC responses to viral stimulus by flow cytometry and Luminex revealed that RRV replicates in a small subset of human primary pDCs and, in this RRV-permissive small subset, IFNα production is diminished. pDC activation and maturation were observed independently of viral replication and were enhanced in cells in which virus replicates. Production of IFNα by pDCs following RRV exposure required viral dsRNA and surface proteins, but neither viral replication nor activation by trypsin cleavage of VP4. These results demonstrate that a minor subset of purified primary human peripheral pDCs are permissive to RRV infection, and that pDCs retain functionality following RRV stimulus. Additionally, this study demonstrates trypsin-independent infection of primary peripheral cells by rotavirus, which may allow for the establishment of extraintestinal viremia and antigenemia. Importantly, these data provide the first evidence of IFNα induction in primary human pDCs by a dsRNA virus, while simultaneously demonstrating impaired IFNα production in primary human cells in which RRV replicates. Rotavirus infection of primary human pDCs provides a powerful experimental system for the study of mechanisms underlying pDC-mediated innate immunity to viral infection and reveals a potentially novel dsRNA-dependent pathway of IFNα induction.",2010-06-03,"Deal, Emily M.; Jaimes, Maria C.; Crawford, Sue E.; Estes, Mary K.; Greenberg, Harry B.",PLoS Pathog,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e12e72939bfeb49c8865a15d0c1bc9a4f99c0ece.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2880586.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2880586/,

We investigated the mechanism by which a mucosal vaccine based in recombinant lactic acid bacteria breaks the immunological tolerance of the gut in order to elicit a protective immune response. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed how the lipid modification of OspA affects the localization of the antigen in our delivery vehicle using a number of biochemistry techniques. Furthermore, we examined how OspA-expressing L. plantarum breaks the oral tolerance of the gut by stimulating human intestinal epithelial cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte derived dendritic cells and measuring cytokine production. We show that the leader peptide of OspA targets the protein to the cell envelope of L. plantarum, and it is responsible for protein export across the membrane. Mutation of the lipidation site in OspA redirects protein localization within the cell envelope. Further, we show that lipidated-OspA-expressing L. plantarum does not induce secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 by intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, it breaks oral tolerance of the gut via Th1/Th2 cell mediated immunity, as shown by the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by human dendritic cells, and by the production of IgG2a and IgG1 antibodies, respectively.

Besides its direct microbicidal activity, HOCl can react with amino acid residues and HOCl-modified proteins can be detected in vivo. FINDINGS: This report is based on binding studies of HOCl-modified serum albumins to HIV-1 gp120 and three different neutralization assays using infectious virus. The binding studies were carried out by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and by standard ELISA techniques. Virus neutralization assays were carried out using HIV-1 NL4-3 virus and recombinant strains with CXCR4 and CCR5 coreceptor usage. Viral infection was monitored by a standard p24 or X-gal staining assay. Our data demonstrate that HOCl-modified mouse-, bovine- and human serum albumins all bind to the HIV-1 NL4-3 gp120 (LAV) glycoprotein in contrast to non-modified albumin. Binding of HOCl-modified albumin to gp120 correlated to the blockade of CD4 as well as that of V3 loop specific monoclonal antibody binding. In neutralization experiments, HOCl-modified serum albumins inhibited replication and syncytium formation of the X4- and R5-tropic NL4-3 isolates in a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that HOCl-modified serum albumin veils the binding site for CD4 and the V3 loop on gp120.

We have observed that PSGs induce transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1), which among its other diverse functions inhibits T-cell function and has proangiogenic properties. The present study investigates a potential role for PSG1, the most abundant PSG in maternal serum, as a possible inducer of proangiogenic growth factors known to play an important role in establishment of the vasculature at the maternal-fetal interface. To this end, we measured TGFB1, vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) A and C, and placental growth factor (PGF) protein levels in several cell types after PSG1 treatment. In addition, tube formation and wound healing assays were performed to investigate a possible direct interaction between PSG1 and endothelial cells. PSG1 induced up-regulation of both TGFB1 and VEGFA in human monocytes, macrophages, and two human extravillous trophoblast cell lines. We did not observe induction of VEGFC or PGF by PSG1 in any of the cells tested. PSG1 treatment resulted in endothelial tube formation in the presence and absence of VEGFA. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to map the essential regions within the N-domain of PSG1 required for functional activity. We found that the aspartic acid at position 95, previously believed to be required for binding of PSGs to cells, is not required for PSG1 activity but that the amino acids implicated in the formation of a salt bridge within the N-domain are essential for PSG1 function.",2010-07-01,"Ha, Cam T.; Wu, Julie A.; Irmak, Ster; Lisboa, Felipe A.; Dizon, Anne M.; Warren, James W.; Ergun, Suleyman; Dveksler, Gabriela S.",Biology of Reproduction,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/004f0f69464edd5466a947da86d38cea9fe7e4fe.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2888962.xml.json,https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article-pdf/83/1/27/10573911/biolreprod0027.pdf,

We report an approach for the computational design of peptide inhibitors of the dengue 2 virus (DENV-2) envelope (E) protein using high-resolution structural data from a pre-entry dimeric form of the protein. By using predictive strategies together with computational optimization of binding “pseudoenergies”, we were able to design multiple peptide sequences that showed low micromolar viral entry inhibitory activity. The two most active peptides, DN57opt and 1OAN1, were designed to displace regions in the domain II hinge, and the first domain I/domain II beta sheet connection, respectively, and show fifty percent inhibitory concentrations of 8 and 7 µM respectively in a focus forming unit assay. The antiviral peptides were shown to interfere with virus:cell binding, interact directly with the E proteins and also cause changes to the viral surface using biolayer interferometry and cryo-electron microscopy, respectively.

The dependence of viruses on cellular factors provides a weak-spot in the viral multiplication strategy and a means to interfere with viral multiplication. RESULTS: Using a motif-based search strategy for antiviral targets we identified caveolin-1 (Cav-1) as a putative cellular interaction partner of human influenza A viruses, including the pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1) strains of swine origin circulating from spring 2009 on. The influence of Cav-1 on human influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus replication was determined in inhibition and competition experiments. RNAi-mediated Cav-1 knock-down as well as transfection of a dominant-negative Cav-1 mutant results in a decrease in virus titre in infected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK), a cell line commonly used in basic influenza research as well as in virus vaccine production. To understand the molecular basis of the phenomenon we focussed on the putative caveolin-1 binding domain (CBD) located in the lumenal, juxtamembranal portion of the M2 matrix protein which has been identified in the motif-based search. Pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that caveolin-1 binds to M2. The data suggest, that Cav-1 modulates influenza virus A replication presumably based on M2/Cav-1 interaction. CONCLUSION: As Cav-1 is involved in the human influenza A virus life cycle, the multifunctional protein and its interaction with M2 protein of human influenza A viruses represent a promising starting point for the search for antiviral agents.",2010-05-26,"Sun, Lijing; Hemgård, Gun-Viol; Susanto, Sony A; Wirth, Manfred",Virol J,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/8843a16da82f4b658269759cbf5ee1e307fc4fd4.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2889940.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2889940/,

Gag localizes to the plasma membrane (PM) and membranes of late endosomes, allowing for release of infectious virus directly from the cell membrane and/or upon exocytosis. The host factors involved in Gag trafficking to these sites are largely unknown. Upon activation, CD4+ T cells, the primary target of HIV infection, express the class II transcriptional activator (CIITA) and therefore the MHC class II isotype, HLA-DR. Similar to Gag, HLA-DR localizes to the PM and at the membranes of endosomes and specialized vesicular MHC class II compartments (MIICs). In HIV producer cells, transient HLA-DR expression induces intracellular Gag accumulation and impairs virus release. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we demonstrate that both stable and transient expression of CIITA in HIV producer cells does not induce HLA-DR-associated intracellular retention of Gag, but does increase the infectivity of virions. However, neither of these phenomena is due to recapitulation of the class II antigen presentation pathway or CIITA-mediated transcriptional activation of virus genes. Interestingly, we demonstrate that CIITA, apart from its transcriptional effects, acts cytoplasmically to enhance Pr160(gag-pol) (Gag-Pol) levels and thereby the viral protease and Gag processing, accounting for the increased infectivity of virions from CIITA-expressing cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that CIITA enhances HIV Gag processing, and provides the first evidence of a novel, post-transcriptional, cytoplasmic function for a well-known transactivator.",2010-06-24,"Porter, Kristen A.; Kelley, Lauren N.; George, Annette; Harton, Jonathan A.; Duus, Karen M.",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/1054ed358dfede6e22877513169bef30c491c363.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2892040.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2892040/,

It is based on novel ideas conceived for fitting the integral equations of the size-and-shape distribution to experimental data, illustrated with an example but provided without proof of the principle of the algorithm. In the present work, we examine the 2DSA algorithm by comparison with the mathematical reference frame and simple well-known numerical concepts for solving Fredholm integral equations, and test the key assumptions underlying the 2DSA method in an example application.

With this in mind we sought to examine the literature for examples of complementary and alternative medicines that reduce inflammation, and to place the results of this search in the context of our own work in a mouse model of influenza disease, using a pharmaceutical agent with anti-inflammatory properties. Two Chinese herbs, Angelica sinensis (Dang Gui) and Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), have been recently shown to protect mice during lethal experimental sepsis via inhibition of the novel inflammatory cytokine High Mobility Group Box 1 protein (HMGB1). Biochanin A, a ligand of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) alpha and gamma and the active isoflavone in Trifolium pratense (red clover), has anti-inflammatory properties, and thus could be used as an influenza treatment. This is of great interest since we have recently shown that gemfibrozil, a drug used to treat hyperlipidemia in humans and a synthetic ligand of PPAR alpha, significantly reduces the mortality associated with influenza infections in mice.

We hypothesise that this was because community transmission of pandemic influenza was already well established in Victoria at the time testing for the novel virus commenced. In contrast, this was not true for the pandemic in other parts of Australia, including Western Australia (WA). METHODS: We used data from detailed case follow-up of patients with confirmed infection in Victoria and WA to demonstrate the difference in the pandemic curve in two Australian states on opposite sides of the continent. We modelled the pandemic in both states, using a susceptible-infected-removed model with Bayesian inference accounting for imported cases. RESULTS: Epidemic transmission occurred earlier in Victoria and later in WA. Only 5% of the first 100 Victorian cases were not locally acquired and three of these were brothers in one family. By contrast, 53% of the first 102 cases in WA were associated with importation from Victoria. Using plausible model input data, estimation of the effective reproductive number for the Victorian epidemic required us to invoke an earlier date for commencement of transmission to explain the observed data. This was not required in modelling the epidemic in WA. CONCLUSION: Strong circumstantial evidence, supported by modelling, suggests community transmission of pandemic influenza was well established in Victoria, but not in WA, at the time testing for the novel virus commenced in Australia.

Here we report that BTV-1 infection of BHK cells is also dependent on a low endosomal pH; however, virus entry and infection were not inhibited by dominant-negative mutants of Eps15, AP180 or the ‘aa’ splice variant of dynamin-2, which were shown to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In addition, infection was not inhibited by depletion of cellular cholesterol, which suggests that virus entry is not mediated by a lipid-raft dependent process such as caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Although virus entry and infection were not inhibited by the dominant-negative dynamin-2 mutant, entry was inhibited by the general dynamin inhibitor, dynasore, indicating that virus entry is dynamin dependent. During entry, BTV-1 co-localised with LAMP-1 but not with transferrin, suggesting that virus is delivered to late-endosomal compartments without first passing through early-endosomes. BTV-1 entry and infection were inhibited by EIPA and cytochalasin-D, known macropinocytosis inhibitors, and during entry virus co-localised with dextran, a known marker for macropinocytosis/fluid-phase uptake.

The proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bid, is activated by proteolytic cleavage following reovirus infection. To understand how reovirus integrates host signaling circuits to induce apoptosis, we examined proapoptotic signaling following infection of Bid-deficient cells. Although reovirus growth was not affected by the absence of Bid, cells lacking Bid failed to undergo apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that NF-κB activation is required for Bid cleavage and subsequent proapoptotic signaling. To examine the functional significance of Bid-dependent apoptosis in reovirus disease, we monitored fatal encephalitis caused by reovirus in the presence and absence of Bid. Survival of Bid-deficient mice was significantly enhanced in comparison to wild-type mice following either peroral or intracranial inoculation of reovirus.

METHODS: We cultured two groups of MG63 cells. One group was treated with PEMFs for 18 hours whereas the second was maintained in the same culture condition without PEMFs (control). Gene expression was evaluated throughout cDNA microarray analysis containing 19,000 genes spanning a substantial fraction of the human genome.

Recent immunological research has focused on innate immunity as the first line of host defense, especially pattern recognition molecules such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). Various microbial components are recognized by their vague and common molecular shapes so-called, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs induce inflammatory reactions mediated by the activation of the transcription factor, NF-κB, and by interferons, which lead to an antiviral immune response.

MPs have different biological effects depending on the cell from they originate. Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by massive neutrophil granulocyte influx in the airways, their activation and eventually apoptosis. We investigated on the presence and phenotype of MPs in the sputum, a rich non-invasive source of inflammation biomarkers, of acute and stable CF adult patients. METHODS: Spontaneous sputum, obtained from 21 CF patients (10 acute and 11 stable) and 7 patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), was liquefied with Sputasol. MPs were counted, visualized by electron microscopy, and identified in the supernatants of treated sputum by cytofluorimetry and immunolabelling for leukocyte (CD11a), granulocyte (CD66b), and monocyte-macrophage (CD11b) antigens. RESULTS: Electron microscopy revealed that sputum MPs were in the 100-500 nm range and did not contain bacteria, confirming microbiological tests. CF sputa contained higher number of MPs in comparison with PCD sputa. Levels of CD11a(+)-and CD66b(+)-, but not CD11b(+)-MPs were significantly higher in CF than in PCD, without differences between acute and stable patients.

Traditionally, Ad-based vaccines are designed to express antigens through transgene expression of a given antigen. However, in some cases these conventional Ad-based vaccines have had sub-optimal clinical results. These sub-optimal results are attributed in part to pre-existing Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) immunity. In order to circumvent the need for antigen expression via transgene incorporation, the “antigen capsid-incorporation” strategy has been developed and used for Ad-based vaccine development in the context of a few diseases. This strategy embodies the incorporation of antigenic peptides within the capsid structure of viral vectors. The major capsid protein hexon has been utilized for these capsid incorporation strategies due to hexon's natural role in the generation of anti-Ad immune response and its numerical representation within the Ad virion. Using this strategy, we have developed the means to incorporate heterologous peptide epitopes specifically within the major surface-exposed domains of the Ad capsid protein hexon. Our study herein focuses on generation of multivalent vaccine vectors presenting HIV antigens within the Ad capsid protein hexon, as well as expressing an HIV antigen as a transgene. These novel vectors utilize HVR2 as an incorporation site for a twenty-four amino acid region of the HIV membrane proximal ectodomain region (MPER), derived from HIV glycoprotein gp41 (gp41).

There are reports of poorer patient outcome in transplant candidates with high MELD score, others though report no influence of MELD score on outcome and survival. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of 144 consecutive liver transplant recipients over a 72-month period in our transplant unit, from January 2003 until December 2008 and performed uni- and multivariate analysis for morbidity and mortality, in particular to define the influence of MELD to these parameters. RESULTS: This study identified MELD score greater than 23 as an independent risk factor of morbidity represented by intensive care unit (ICU) stay longer than 10 days (odds ratio 7.0) but in contrast had no negative impact on mortality. Furthermore, we identified transfusion of more than 7 units of red blood cells as independent risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio 7.6) and for prolonged ICU stay (odds ratio [OR] 7.8) together with transfusion of more than 10 units of fresh frozen plasma (OR 11.6). Postoperative renal failure is a strong predictor of morbidity (OR 7.9) and postoperative renal replacement therapy was highly associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio 6.8), as was hepato renal syndrome prior to transplantation (hazard ratio 13.2).

By performing two cross-sectional questionnaire surveys during winter 2009 and winter 2010 among European travellers to resource-limited destinations, we aimed to investigate knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding seasonal influenza vaccination. METHODS: Questionnaires were distributed in the waiting room to the visitors of the University of Zurich Centre for Travel' Health (CTH) in January and February 2009 and January 2010 prior to travel health counselling (CTH09 and CTH10). Questions included demographic data, travel-related characteristics and KAP regarding influenza vaccination. Data were analysed by using SPSS(® )version 14.0 for Windows. Differences in proportions were compared using the Chi-square test and the significance level was set at p ≤ 0.05. Predictors for seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination were determined by multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: With a response rate of 96.6%, 906 individuals were enrolled and 868 (92.5%) provided complete data. Seasonal influenza vaccination coverage was 13.7% (n = 119). Only 43 (14.2%) participants were vaccinated against pandemic influenza A/H1N1, mostly having received both vaccines simultaneously, the seasonal and pandemic one. Job-related purposes (44, 37%), age > 64 yrs (25, 21%) and recommendations of the family physician (27, 22.7%) were the most often reported reasons for being vaccinated. In the multiple logistic regression analyses of the pooled data increasing age (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.04), a business trip (OR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 - 0.92) and seasonal influenza vaccination in the previous winter seasons (OR = 12.91, 95% CI 8.09 - 20.58) were independent predictors for seasonal influenza vaccination in 2009 or 2010. Influenza vaccination recommended by the family doctor (327, 37.7%), travel to regions with known high risk of influenza (305, 35.1%), and influenza vaccination required for job purposes (233, 26.8%) were most frequently mentioned to consider influenza vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Risk perception and vaccination coverage concerning seasonal and pandemic influenza was very poor among travellers to resource-limited destinations when compared to traditional at-risk groups. Previous access to influenza vaccination substantially facilitated vaccinations in the subsequent year.

For serodiagnosis of echinococcosis, especially cystic disease, most screening tests rely on crude or purified Echinococcus granulosus hydatid cyst fluid. To resolve limitations associated with native antigens in serological tests, the use of standardized and highly pure antigens produced by chemical synthesis offers considerable advantages, provided appropriate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity is achieved. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Making use of the growing collection of genomic and proteomic data, we applied a set of bioinformatic selection criteria to a collection of protein sequences including conceptually translated nucleotide sequence data of two related tapeworms, Echinococcus multilocularis and Echinococcus granulosus. Our approach targeted alpha-helical coiled-coils and intrinsically unstructured regions of parasite proteins potentially exposed to the host immune system. From 6 proteins of E. multilocularis and 5 proteins of E. granulosus, 45 peptides between 24 and 30 amino acids in length were designed. These peptides were chemically synthesized, spotted on microarrays and screened for reactivity with sera from infected humans. Peptides reacting above the cut-off were validated in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Peptides identified failed to differentiate between E. multilocularis and E. granulosus infection. The peptide performing best reached 57% sensitivity and 94% specificity. This candidate derived from Echinococcus multilocularis antigen B8/1 and showed strong reactivity to sera from patients infected either with E. multilocularis or E. granulosus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides proof of principle for the discovery of diagnostically relevant peptides by bioinformatic selection complemented with screening on a high-throughput microarray platform. Our data showed that a single peptide cannot provide sufficient diagnostic sensitivity whereas pooling several peptide antigens improved sensitivity; thus combinations of several peptides may lead the way to new diagnostic tests that replace, or at least complement conventional immunodiagnosis of echinococcosis.

Pre-existing CD8(+) T-cell immunity directed towards conserved internal viral regions can greatly ameliorate the disease. However, mutational escape within the T cell epitopes is a substantial issue for virus control and vaccine design. Although mutations can result in a loss of T cell recognition, some variants generate cross-reactive T cell responses. In this study, we used reverse genetics to modify the influenza NP(336–374) peptide at a partially-solvent exposed residue (N->A, NPN3A mutation) to assess the availability, effectiveness and mechanism underlying influenza-specific cross-reactive T cell responses. The engineered virus induced a diminished CD8(+) T cell response and selected a narrowed T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire within two Vβ regions (Vβ8.3 and Vβ9). This can be partially explained by the H-2D(b)NPN3A structure that showed a loss of several contacts between the NPN3A peptide and H-2D(b), including a contact with His155, a position known to play an important role in mediating TCR-pMHC-I interactions. Despite these differences, common cross-reactive TCRs were detected in both the naïve and immune NPN3A-specific TCR repertoires. However, while the NPN3A epitope primes memory T-cells that give an equivalent recall response to the mutant or wild-type (wt) virus, both are markedly lower than wt->wt challenge. Such decreased CD8(+) responses elicited after heterologous challenge resulted in delayed viral clearance from the infected lung. Furthermore, mice first exposed to the wt virus give a poor, low avidity response following secondary infection with the mutant. Thus, the protective efficacy of cross-reactive CD8(+) T cells recognising mutant viral epitopes depend on peptide-MHC-I structural interactions and functional avidity. Our study does not support vaccine strategies that include immunization against commonly selected cross-reactive variants with mutations at partially-solvent exposed residues that have characteristics comparable to NPN3A.",2010-08-12,"Valkenburg, Sophie A.; Gras, Stephanie; Guillonneau, Carole; La Gruta, Nicole L.; Thomas, Paul G.; Purcell, Anthony W.; Rossjohn, Jamie; Doherty, Peter C.; Turner, Stephen J.; Kedzierska, Katherine",PLoS Pathog,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/aa1f783a1af8b14cdbee5ea50cc0a78c56d7442e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2920842.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2920842/,

We propose that the progression of cancer cells towards malignant phenotypes can be efficiently tracked using high-throughput technologies that follow the gradual changes observed in the gene expression profiles by employing Shannon's mathematical theory of communication. Methods based on Information Theory can then quantify the divergence of cancer cells' transcriptional profiles from those of normally appearing cells of the originating tissues. The relevance of the proposed methods can be evaluated using microarray datasets available in the public domain but the method is in principle applicable to other high-throughput methods. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using melanoma and prostate cancer datasets we illustrate how it is possible to employ Shannon Entropy and the Jensen-Shannon divergence to trace the transcriptional changes progression of the disease. We establish how the variations of these two measures correlate with established biomarkers of cancer progression. The Information Theory measures allow us to identify novel biomarkers for both progressive and relatively more sudden transcriptional changes leading to malignant phenotypes. At the same time, the methodology was able to validate a large number of genes and processes that seem to be implicated in the progression of melanoma and prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We thus present a quantitative guiding rule, a new unifying hallmark of cancer: the cancer cell's transcriptome changes lead to measurable observed transitions of Normalized Shannon Entropy values (as measured by high-througput technologies). At the same time, tumor cells increment their divergence from the normal tissue profile increasing their disorder via creation of states that we might not directly measure. This unifying hallmark allows, via the the Jensen-Shannon divergence, to identify the arrow of time of the processes from the gene expression profiles, and helps to map the phenotypical and molecular hallmarks of specific cancer subtypes.

We adopt some of the most widely used epidemiological models, investigating the impact of the reshaping of the contact network on the disease dynamics. We derive analytical results in the limit where network reshaping occurs much faster than disease spreading and demonstrate numerically that this limit extends to a much wider range of time scales than one might anticipate. Specifically, we show that from a population-level description, disease propagation in a quickly adapting network can be formulated equivalently as disease spreading on a well-mixed population but with a rescaled infectiousness. We find that for all models studied here – SI, SIS and SIR – the effective infectiousness of a disease depends on the population size, the number of infected in the population, and the capacity of healthy individuals to sever contacts with the infected. Importantly, we indicate how the use of available information hinders disease progression, either by reducing the average time required to eradicate a disease (in case recovery is possible), or by increasing the average time needed for a disease to spread to the entire population (in case recovery or immunity is impossible).",2010-08-19,"Van Segbroeck, Sven; Santos, Francisco C.; Pacheco, Jorge M.",PLoS Comput Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d61d66e22524793eb025db202a84eaaae50da2bf.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a0016598cd0ea40803d8ab461f4ebdba9abe94c1.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2924249.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2924249/,

Proteomics analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has detected a number of proteins that were elevated in MScl patients. Here we specifically aimed to differentiate between the PP and RR subtypes of MScl by comparing CSF proteins. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CSF samples (n = 31) were handled according to the same protocol for quantitative mass spectrometry measurements we reported previously. In the comparison of PP MScl versus RR MScl we observed a number of differentially abundant proteins, such as protein jagged-1 and vitamin D-binding protein. Protein jagged-1 was over three times less abundant in PP MScl compared to RR MScl. Vitamin D-binding protein was only detected in the RR MScl samples. These two proteins were validated by independent techniques (western blot and ELISA) as differentially abundant in the comparison between both MScl types. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The main finding of this comparative study is the observation that the proteome profiles of CSF in PP and RR MScl patients overlap to a large extent. Still, a number of differences could be observed. Protein jagged-1 is a ligand for multiple Notch receptors and involved in the mediation of Notch signaling. It is suggested in literature that the Notch pathway is involved in the remyelination of MScl lesions. Aberration of normal homeostasis of Vitamin D, of which approximately 90% is bound to vitamin D-binding protein, has been widely implicated in MScl for some years now. Vitamin D directly and indirectly regulates the differentiation, activation of CD4+ T-lymphocytes and can prevent the development of autoimmune processes, and so it may be involved in neuroprotective elements in MScl.",2010-08-27,"Stoop, Marcel P.; Singh, Vaibhav; Dekker, Lennard J.; Titulaer, Mark K.; Stingl, Christoph; Burgers, Peter C.; Sillevis Smitt, Peter A.

These disorders are characterized by inflammatory and fibrotic changes that affect alveolar walls. Typical features of ILD include dyspnea, diffuse infiltrates on chest radiographs, and abnormal pulmonary function tests with restrictive ventilatory defect and/or impaired gas exchange. Many pathological situations can impair gas exchange and, therefore, may contribute to progressive lung damage and ILD. Consequently, diagnosis approach needs to be structured with a clinical evaluation requiring a careful history paying attention to exposures and systemic diseases. Several classifications for ILD have been proposed but none is entirely satisfactory especially in children. The present article reviews current concepts of pathophysiological mechanisms, etiology and diagnostic approaches, as well as therapeutic strategies. The following diagnostic grouping is used to discuss the various causes of pediatric ILD: 1) exposure-related ILD; 2) systemic disease-associated ILD; 3) alveolar structure disorder-associated ILD; and 4) ILD specific to infancy. Therapeutic options include mainly anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and/or anti-fibrotic drugs. The outcome is highly variable with a mortality rate around 15%.

Critical, early control steps would be greatly enhanced if the key risk factors can be identified that accurately predict early disease spread immediately after emergence. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we examine the role of travel, trade, and national healthcare resources in predicting the emergence and initial spread of 2009 A/H1N1 influenza. We find that incorporating national healthcare resource data into our analyses allowed a much greater capacity to predict the international spread of this virus. In countries with lower healthcare resources, the reporting of 2009 A/H1N1 cases was significantly delayed, likely reflecting a lower capacity for testing and reporting, as well as other socio-political issues. We also report substantial international trade in live swine and poultry in the decade preceding the pandemic which may have contributed to the emergence and mixed genotype of this pandemic strain. However, the lack of knowledge of recent evolution of each H1N1 viral gene segment precludes the use of this approach to determine viral origins. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that strategies to prevent pandemic influenza virus emergence and spread in the future should include: 1) enhanced surveillance for strains resulting from reassortment in traded livestock; 2) rapid deployment of control measures in the initial spreading phase to countries where travel data predict the pathogen will reach and to countries where lower healthcare resources will likely cause delays in reporting. Our results highlight the benefits, for all parties, when higher income countries provide additional healthcare resources for lower income countries, particularly those that have high air traffic volumes. In particular, international authorities should prioritize aid to those poorest countries where both the risk of emerging infectious diseases and air traffic volume is highest.

A new theory based on analysis, simulation and empirical study challenges this predictor of success. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that the quantity [Image: see text] is a valid predictor in structured populations only when size is infinite. In this article we show that when population size is finite the dynamics of infection by multi-strain pathogens is a stochastic process whose outcome can be predicted by evolutionary entropy, S, an information theoretic measure which describes the uncertainty in the infectious age of an infected parent of a randomly chosen new infective. Evolutionary entropy characterises the demographic stability or robustness of the population of infectives. This statistical parameter determines the duration of infection and thus provides a quantitative index of the pathogenicity of a strain. Standard epidemiological theory based on [Image: see text] as a measure of selective advantage is the limit as the population size tends to infinity of the entropic selection theory. The standard model is an approximation to the entropic selection theory whose validity increases with population size.

Furthermore, we derive general analytical results for the statistical properties of emergence events, including the probability distribution of outbreak sizes.

Real time RT-PCR evidence showed that matrix and hemagglutinin genes were positive in liver and spleen in addition to positive tissues with virus isolation. Immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization stains showed accordant evidence of viral infection with real time RT-PCR except bronchus. Quantitative RT-PCR suggested that a high viral load was associated with increased host responses, though the viral load was significantly different in various organs. Cells of the immunologic system could also be a target for virus infection. Overall, the pathogenesis of HPAI H5N1 virus was associated both with virus replication and with immunopathologic lesions.

METHODOLOGY: Data from cross-sectional telephone interviews of 1,001 Hong Kong adults in June, 2009 were tested against theory and data-derived hypothesized associations between trust in (formal/informal) information, understanding, self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility and worry, and hand hygiene and social distancing using Structural Equation Modelling with multigroup comparisons. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Trust in formal (government/media) information about influenza was associated with greater reported understanding of A/H1N1 cause (β = 0.36) and A/H1N1 prevention self-efficacy (β = 0.25), which in turn were associated with more hand hygiene (β = 0.19 and β = 0.23, respectively). Trust in informal (interpersonal) information was negatively associated with perceived personal A/H1N1 susceptibility (β = −0.21), which was negatively associated with perceived self-efficacy (β = −0.42) but positively associated with influenza worry (β = 0.44). Trust in informal information was positively associated with influenza worry (β = 0.16) which was in turn associated with greater social distancing (β = 0.36). Multigroup comparisons showed gender differences regarding paths from trust in formal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, trust in informal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, and understanding of A/H1N1 cause to perceived self-efficacy.

Antibiotics may provide little immediate relief to patients who have a high bacteremia or to patients infected with an antibiotic resistant strain of plague. Two virulent factors of Y. pestis are the capsid F1 protein and the low-calcium response (Lcr) V-protein or V-antigen that have been proven to be the targets for both active and passive immunization. There are mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the F1- and V-antigens that can passively protect mice in a murine model of plague; however, there are no anti-Yersinia pestis monoclonal antibodies available for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment in humans. We identified one anti-F1-specific human mAb (m252) and two anti-V-specific human mAb (m253, m254) by panning a naïve phage-displayed Fab library against the F1- and V-antigens. The Fabs were converted to IgG1s and their binding and protective activities were evaluated. M252 bound weakly to peptides located at the F1 N-terminus where a protective mouse anti-F1 mAb also binds. M253 bound strongly to a V-antigen peptide indicating a linear epitope; m254 did not bind to any peptide from a panel of 53 peptides suggesting that its epitope may be conformational. M252 showed better protection than m253 and m254 against a Y, pestis challenge in a plague mouse model. A synergistic effect was observed when the three antibodies were combined. Incomplete to complete protection was achieved when m252 was given at different times post-challenge.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of TREM-1 and of C-reactive protein (CRP) from patients with lung infiltrates to discern community acquired lung infections. METHODS: 68 patients admitted to a medical ward with acute respiratory illness were enrolled in the study. Neutrophil and monocyte TREM-1 expression were measured by flow cytometry, sTREM-1 by an enzyme immunoassay and C-reactive protein by nephelometry. Clinical pulmonary infection score was recorded. RESULTS: 34 patients were diagnosed with bacterial community acquired pneumonia (group A) and 34 with non-bacterial pulmonary disease (group B).

Here we evaluate the microbial biota in healthy mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) by analyses of lymph node meta-transcriptomes. cDNA libraries from five individuals and two pools of samples were prepared from retropharyngeal lymph node RNA enriched for polyadenylated RNA and sequenced using Roche-454 Life Sciences technology. Protein-coding and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences were taxonomically profiled using protein and rRNA specific databases. Representatives of all bacterial phyla were detected in the seven libraries based on protein-coding transcripts indicating that viable microbiota were present in lymph nodes. Residents of skin and rumen, and those ubiquitous in mule deer habitat dominated classifiable bacterial species. Based on detection of both rRNA and protein-coding transcripts, we identified two new proteobacterial species; a Helicobacter closely related to Helicobacter cetorum in the Helicobacter pylori/Helicobacter acinonychis complex and an Acinetobacter related to Acinetobacter schindleri. Among viruses, a novel gamma retrovirus and other members of the Poxviridae and Retroviridae were identified. We additionally evaluated bacterial diversity by amplicon sequencing the hypervariable V6 region of 16S rRNA and demonstrate that overall taxonomic diversity is higher with the meta-transcriptomic approach.

The peripheral pr peptide remains bound to virus at low pH and inhibits virus-membrane interaction. Upon exocytosis, the release of pr at neutral pH completes virus maturation to an infectious particle. Together this evidence suggests that pr may shield the flavivirus fusion protein E from the low pH environment of the exocytic pathway. Here we developed an in vitro system to reconstitute the interaction of dengue virus (DENV) pr with soluble truncated E proteins. At low pH recombinant pr bound to both monomeric and dimeric forms of E and blocked their membrane insertion. Exogenous pr interacted with mature infectious DENV and specifically inhibited virus fusion and infection. Alanine substitution of E H244, a highly conserved histidine residue in the pr-E interface, blocked pr-E interaction and reduced release of DENV virus-like particles. Folding, membrane insertion and trimerization of the H244A mutant E protein were preserved, and particle release could be partially rescued by neutralization of the low pH of the secretory pathway. Thus, pr acts to silence flavivirus fusion activity during virus secretion, and this function can be separated from the chaperone activity of prM. The sequence conservation of key residues involved in the flavivirus pr-E interaction suggests that this protein-protein interface may be a useful target for broad-spectrum inhibitors.",2010-10-21,"Zheng, Aihua; Umashankar, Mahadevaiah; Kielian, Margaret",PLoS Pathog,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/39772fc7033bdfcfd0a6fb689d7a5c8bff2d80e1.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2958806.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2958806/,

Thus, it is important to explore the mechanism(s) controlling alternative splicing of CD200. In this study, we identified an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) located in exon 2, which is a putative binding site for a splicing regulatory protein SF2/ASF. Deletion or mutation of the ESE site decreased expression of the full-length CD200. Direct binding of SF2/ASF to the ESE site was confirmed by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Knockdown of expression of SF2/ASF resulted in the same splicing pattern as seen after deletion or mutation of the ESE, whereas overexpression of SF2/ASF increased expression of the full-length CD200. In vivo studies showed that viral infection reversed the alternative splicing pattern of CD200 with increased expression of SF2/ASF and the full-length CD200.

The objective of this study was to compare the short-term virological efficacy of oseltamivir-zanamivir combination versus each monotherapy plus placebo. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial with 145 general practitioners throughout France during the 2008–2009 seasonal influenza epidemic. Patients, general practitioners, and outcome assessors were all blinded to treatment assignment. Adult outpatients presenting influenza-like illness for less than 36 hours and a positive influenza A rapid test diagnosis were randomized to oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice daily plus zanamivir 10 mg by inhalation twice daily (OZ), oseltamivir plus inhaled placebo (O), or zanamivir plus oral placebo (Z). Treatment efficacy was assessed virologically according to the proportion of patients with nasal influenza reverse transcription (RT)-PCR below 200 copies genome equivalent (cgeq)/µl at day 2 (primary outcome), and clinically to the time to alleviation of symptoms until day 14. Overall 541 patients (of the 900 planned) were included (OZ, n = 192; O, n = 176; Z, n = 173), 49% male, mean age 39 years. In the intention-to-treat analysis conducted in the 447 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed influenza A, 46%, 59%, and 34% in OZ (n = 157), O (n = 141), and Z (n = 149) arms had RT-PCR<200 cgeq/µl (−13.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] −23.1 to −2.9, p = 0.025; +12.3%, 95% CI 2.39–22.2, p = 0.028 for OZ/O and OZ/Z comparisons). Mean day 0 to day 2 viral load decrease was 2.14, 2.49, and 1.68 log(10) cgeq/µl (p = 0.060, p = 0.016 for OZ/O and OZ/Z). Median time to alleviation of symptoms was 4.0, 3.0, and 4.0 days (+1.0, 95% CI 0.0–4.0, p = 0.018; +0.0, 95% CI −3.0 to 3.0, p = 0.960 for OZ/O and OZ/Z). Four severe adverse events were observed. Nausea and/or vomiting tended to be more frequent in the combination arm (OZ, n = 13; O, n = 4; and Z, n = 5 patients, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In adults with seasonal influenza A mainly H3N2 virus infection, the oseltamivir-zanamivir combination appeared less effective than oseltamivir monotherapy, and not significantly more effective than zanamivir monotherapy. Despite the theoretical potential for the reduction of the emergence of antiviral resistance, the lower effectiveness of this combination calls for caution in its use in clinical practice.

The initial clinical presentation can mimic other pediatric inflammatory conditions, which often leads to significant delays in diagnosis and appropriate therapy. SJIA biomarker development is an unmet diagnostic/prognostic need to prevent disease complications. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We profiled the urine peptidome to analyze a set of 102 urine samples, from patients with SJIA, Kawasaki disease (KD), febrile illnesses (FI), and healthy controls. A set of 91 plasma samples, from SJIA flare and quiescent patients, were profiled using a customized antibody array against 43 proteins known to be involved in inflammatory and protein catabolic processes. RESULTS: We identified a 17-urine-peptide biomarker panel that could effectively discriminate SJIA patients at active, quiescent, and remission disease states, and patients with active SJIA from confounding conditions including KD and FI. Targeted sequencing of these peptides revealed that they fall into several tight clusters from seven different proteins, suggesting disease-specific proteolytic activities. The antibody array plasma profiling identified an SJIA plasma flare signature consisting of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1), interleukin (IL)-18, regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), P-Selectin, MMP9, and L-Selectin. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The urine peptidomic and plasma protein analyses have the potential to improve SJIA care and suggest that SJIA urine peptide biomarkers may be an outcome of inflammation-driven effects on catabolic pathways operating at multiple sites.

Crystals of a fragment of the neck domain of DC-SIGNR containing multiple repeats in which each molecule extends through multiple unit cells, such that the observed crystallographic asymmetric unit represents one repeat averaged over six repeats of the protein, have been obtained. The repeats are largely α-helical. Based on the structure and arrangement of the repeats in the crystal, the neck region can be described as a series of four-helix bundles connected by short, non-helical linkers. Combining the structure of the isolated neck domain with a previously determined overlapping structure of the distal end of the neck region with the CRDs attached provides a model of the almost-complete extracellular portion of the receptor. The results are consistent with previous characterization of the extended structure for the isolated neck region and the extracellular domain.

Here we propose a method to calculate the minimal amount of genomic information needed to construct organism (effective information) as a measure of organismal complexity, by using permutation and combination formulas and Shannon's information concept. RESULTS: The results demonstrate that the calculated information correlates quite well with the intuitive organismal phenotypic complexity defined by traditional taxonomy and evolutionary theory. From viruses to human beings, the effective information gradually increases, from thousands of bits to hundreds of millions of bits. The simpler the organism is, the less the information; the more complex the organism, the more the information. About 13% of human genome is estimated as effective information or functional sequence.

To assess whether certain environmental factors temporally associated with the onset of juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (JIIMs) differ between phenotypes. Methods. Physicians completed questionnaires regarding documented infections, medications, immunizations and an open-ended question about other noted exposures within 6 months before illness onset for 285 patients with probable or definite JIIM. Medical records were reviewed for 81% of the patients. Phenotypes were defined by standard clinical and laboratory measures. Results. Sixty per cent of JIIM patients had a reported exposure within 6 months before illness onset. Most patients (62%) had one recorded exposure, 26% had two and 12% had three to five exposures. Patients older than the median age at diagnosis, those with a longer delay to diagnosis and those with anti-signal recognition particle autoantibodies had a higher frequency of documented exposures [odds ratios (ORs) 95% CI 3.4, 31]. Infections were the most common exposure and represented 44% of the total number of reported exposures. Non-infectious exposures included medications (18%), immunizations (11%), stressful life events (11%) and unusual sun exposure (7%). Exposures varied by age at diagnosis, race, disease course and the presence of certain myositis autoantibodies. Conclusion. The JIIMs may be related to multiple exposures and these appear to vary among phenotypes.",2010-08-27,"Rider, Lisa G.; Wu, Lan; Mamyrova, Gulnara; Targoff, Ira N.; Miller, Frederick W.",Rheumatology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b55a0e31017b0b12cb2d82f0b23dfaf1d619528e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2981509.xml.json,https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article-pdf/49/12/2381/5065535/keq277.pdf,

Although RNA synthesis and virus assembly occur in the cytoplasm, HRSV is known to induce nuclear responses in the host cell as replication alters global gene expression. Quantitative proteomics was used to take an unbiased overview of the protein changes in transformed human alveolar basal epithelial cells infected with HRSV. Underpinning this was the use of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS, which allowed the direct and simultaneous identification and quantification of both cellular and viral proteins. To reduce sample complexity and increase data return on potential protein localization, cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. This resulted in the identification of 1,140 cellular proteins and six viral proteins. The proteomics data were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis to identify defined canonical pathways and functional groupings. Selected data were validated using Western blot, direct and indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, and functional assays. The study served to validate and expand upon known HRSV-host cell interactions, including those associated with the antiviral response and alterations in subnuclear structures such as the nucleolus and ND10 (promyelocytic leukemia bodies). In addition, novel changes were observed in mitochondrial proteins and functions, cell cycle regulatory molecules, nuclear pore complex proteins and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking proteins. These data shed light into how the cell is potentially altered to create conditions more favorable for infection. Additionally, the study highlights the application and advantage of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS for the analysis of virus-host interactions.",2010-07-20,"Munday, Diane C.; Emmott, Edward; Surtees, Rebecca; Lardeau, Charles-Hugues; Wu, Weining; Duprex, W.

Detecting viral movement by sequence analysis is complicated by skewed geographic and seasonal distributions in viral isolates. We propose a probabilistic method that accounts for sampling bias through spatiotemporal clustering and modeling regional and seasonal transmission as a binomial process. Analysis of H3N2 not only confirmed East-Southeast Asia as a source of new seasonal variants, but also increased the resolution of observed transmission to a country level. H1N1 data revealed similar viral spread from the tropics. Network analysis suggested China and Hong Kong as the origins of new seasonal H3N2 strains and the United States as a region where increased vaccination would maximally disrupt global spread of the virus.

Vaccination for influenza is one of the most important primary preventative measures to reduce the disease burden. Our study aims to assess the willingness of nurses who work for the community nursing service (CNS) in Hong Kong on their acceptance of influenza A (H1N1) influenza vaccination. METHODS: 401 questionnaires were posted from June 24, 2009 to June 30, 2009 to community nurses with 67% response rate. Results of the 267 respondents on their willingness to accept influenza A (H1N1) vaccine were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-seven percent of respondents were willing to accept influenza vaccination if vaccines were available. Having been vaccinated for seasonable influenza in the previous 12 months were significantly independently associated with their willingness to accept influenza A (H1N1) vaccination (OR = 4.03; 95% CI: 2.03-7.98). CONCLUSIONS: Similar to previous findings conducted in hospital healthcare workers and nurses, we confirmed that the willingness of community nurses to accept influenza A (H1N1) vaccination is low.

The current report describes the generation of a new approach to reverse genetics recovery of genetically defined MNV that relies on the transfection of in vitro transcribed capped RNA directly into cells. The use of the recently developed ScriptCap post-transcriptional enzymatic capping system, followed by optimized Neon mediated electroporation of the highly permissive RAW 264.7 cells, resulted in the rapid and robust recovery of infectious MNV. Transfection of cells capable of supporting virus replication but not permissive to virus infection, namely human or hamster kidney cells, also resulted in robust recovery of infectious virus without subsequent amplification by multiple rounds of re-infection.

FINDINGS: The Richards model and its variants are used to fit the cumulative epidemic curve for laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) infections in Canada, made available by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). The model is used to obtain estimates for turning points in the initial outbreak, the basic reproductive number (R(0)), and for expected final outbreak size in the absence of interventions. Confirmed case data were used to construct a best-fit 2-phase model with three turning points. R(0 )was estimated to be 1.30 (95% CI 1.12-1.47) for the first phase (April 1 to May 4) and 1.35 (95% CI 1.16-1.54) for the second phase (May 4 to June 19). Hospitalization data were also used to fit a 1-phase model with R(0 )= 1.35 (1.20-1.49) and a single turning point of June 11. CONCLUSIONS: Application of the Richards model to Canadian pH1N1 data shows that detection of turning points is affected by the quality of data available at the time of data usage. Using a Richards model, robust estimates of R(0 )were obtained approximately one month after the initial outbreak in the case of 2009 A (H1N1) in Canada.",2010-11-05,"Hsieh, Ying-Hen; Fisman, David N; Wu, Jianhong",BMC Res Notes,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/23372fae9cc1e03d11351e3ddb52036e1d378c40.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2989981.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2989981/,

Currently no therapeutic interventions are available for JE, thereby making it one of the most dreaded encephalitides in the world. An effective way to counter the virus would be to inhibit viral replication by using anti-sense molecules directed against the viral genome. Octaguanidinium dendrimer-conjugated Morpholino (or Vivo-Morpholino) are uncharged anti-sense oligomers that can enter cells of living organisms by endocytosis and subsequently escape from endosomes into the cytosol/nuclear compartment of cells. We hypothesize that Vivo-Morpholinos generated against specific regions of 3′ or 5′ untranslated regions of JEV genome, when administered in an experimental model of JE, will have significant antiviral and neuroprotective effect. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mice were infected with JEV (GP78 strain) followed by intraperitoneal administration of Morpholinos (5 mg/kg body weight) daily for up to five treatments. Survivability of the animals was monitored for 15 days (or until death) following which they were sacrificed and their brains were processed either for immunohistochemical staining or protein extraction. Plaque assay and immunoblot analysis performed from brain homogenates showed reduced viral load and viral protein expression, resulting in greater survival of infected animals. Neuroprotective effect was observed by thionin staining of brain sections. Cytokine bead array showed reduction in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in brain following Morpholino treatment, which were elevated after infection. This corresponded to reduced microglial activation in brain. Oxidative stress was reduced and certain stress-related signaling molecules were found to be positively modulated following Morpholino treatment. In vitro studies also showed that there was decrease in infective viral particle production following Morpholino treatment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Administration of Vivo-Morpholino effectively resulted in increased survival of animals and neuroprotection in a murine model of JE. Hence, these oligomers represent a potential antiviral agent that merits further evaluation.",2010-11-23,"Nazmi, Arshed; Dutta, Kallol; Basu, Anirban",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/fd5e3020671499cde830bd25de618009ece0af13.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2990691.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2990691/,

We describe eight cases of H1N1 infection in cancer patients admitted to the intensive care unit of a referral cancer center. Patients and methods: Clinical data from all patients admitted with acute respiratory failure due to novel viral H1N1 infection were reviewed. Lung tissue was submitted for viral and bacteriological analyses by real-time RT-PCR, and autopsy was conducted on all patients who died. Results: Eight patients were admitted, with ages ranging from 55 to 65 years old. There were five patients with solid organ tumors (62.5%) and three with hematological malignancies (37.5%). Five patients required mechanical ventilation and all died. Four patients had bacterial bronchopneumonia. All deaths occurred due to multiple organ failure. A milder form of lung disease was present in the three cases who survived. Lung tissue analysis was performed in all patients and showed diffuse alveolar damage in most patients. Other lung findings were necrotizing bronchiolitis or extensive hemorrhage.

There is currently a debate on when and how such measures should be loosened. To forecast the demand for hospital intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU beds for COVID-19 patients from May to September, we developed 2 models, assuming a gradual easing of restrictions or an intermittent lockdown. METHODS: We used a compartmental model to evaluate 2 scenarios: (A) an intermittent lockdown; (B) a gradual relaxation of the lockdown. Predicted ICU and non-ICU demand was compared with the peak in hospital bed use observed in April 2020. RESULTS: Under scenario A, while ICU demand will remain below the peak, the number of non-ICU will substantially rise and will exceed it (133%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 94-171). Under scenario B, a rise in ICU and non-ICU demand will start in July and will progressively increase over the summer 2020, reaching 95% (95% CI: 71-121) and 237% (95% CI: 191-282) of the April peak.

Among these contaminants, deoxynivalenol (DON), also known as vomitoxin, is the most prevalent type B trichothecene mycotoxin worldwide. Pigs are very sensitive to the toxic effects of DON and are frequently exposed to naturally contaminated feed. Recently, DON naturally contaminated feed has been shown to decrease porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) specific antibody responses following experimental infection. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of DON naturally contaminated feed on the immune response generated following vaccination with PRRSV live attenuated vaccine. Eighteen pigs were randomly divided into three experimental groups of 6 animals based on DON content of the diets (0, 2.5 and 3.5 mg DON/kg). They were fed these rations one week prior to the vaccination and for all the duration of the immune response evaluation. All pigs were vaccinated intra-muscularly with one dose of Ingelvac(®) PRRSV modified live vaccine (MLV). Blood samples were collected at day −1, 6, 13, 20, 27 and 35 post vaccination (pv) and tested for PRRSV RNA by RT-qPCR and for virus specific antibodies by ELISA. Results showed that ingestion of DON-contaminated diets significantly decreased PRRSV viremia. All pigs fed control diet were viremic while only 1 (17%) and 3 (50%) out of 6 pigs were viremic in the groups receiving 3.5 and 2.5 mg of DON/kg, respectively. Subsequently, all pigs fed control diet developed PRRSV specific antibodies while only viremic pigs that were fed contaminated diets have developed PRRSV specific antibodies.

A deadly communicable disease outbreak, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Toronto in 2003, amplifies the difficulties of hospital priority setting. The purpose of this study is to describe and evaluate priority setting in a hospital in response to SARS using the ethical framework 'accountability for reasonableness'. METHODS: This study was conducted at a large tertiary hospital in Toronto, Canada. There were two data sources: 1) over 200 key documents (e.g. emails, bulletins), and 2) 35 interviews with key informants. Analysis used a modified thematic technique in three phases: open coding, axial coding, and evaluation. RESULTS: Participants described the types of priority setting decisions, the decision making process and the reasoning used. Although the hospital leadership made an effort to meet the conditions of 'accountability for reasonableness', they acknowledged that the decision making was not ideal. We described good practices and opportunities for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: 'Accountability for reasonableness' is a framework that can be used to guide fair priority setting in health care organizations, such as hospitals. In the midst of a crisis such as SARS where guidance is incomplete, consequences uncertain, and information constantly changing, where hour-by-hour decisions involve life and death, fairness is more important rather than less.",2004-12-19,"Bell, Jennifer AH; Hyland, Sylvia; DePellegrin, Tania; Upshur, Ross EG; Bernstein, Mark; Martin, Douglas K",BMC Health Serv Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a945fe15ef46edadf3f4712668dfc7ee8e5c821d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC544195.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15606924/,2329981

Since diabetes is a risk factor for many infectious diseases, this increase probably adds to the large infectious disease burden in tropical countries. We reviewed the literature to investigate the interface between diabetes and infections in tropical countries, including the WHO-defined neglected tropical diseases. Although solid data are sparse, patients with diabetes living in tropical countries most likely face increased risks of common and health-care-associated infections, as well as infected foot ulcers, which often lead to amputation. There is strong evidence that diabetes increases the severity of some endemic infections such as tuberculosis, melioidosis, and dengue virus infection. Some HIV and antiparasitic drugs might induce diabetes, whereas helminth infections appear to afford some protection against future diabetes. But there are no or very scarce data for most tropical infections and for possible biological mechanisms underlying associations with diabetes. The rise in diabetes and other non-communicable diseases puts a heavy toll on health systems in tropical countries. On the other hand, complications common to both diabetes and some tropical infections might provide an opportunity for shared services—for example, for eye health (trachoma and onchocerciasis), ulcer care (leprosy), or renal support (schistosomiasis).

The objective of this double-blind randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of oral inorganic or organic zinc supplementation as a treatment for neonatal diarrhea in calves. Seventy nine 1 to 8 day old male Holstein calves on a California calf ranch were block randomized to one of 3 treatments within 24 h from their first onset of diarrhea. Calves received a daily dose of either a placebo composed of 80 mg of zinc-free powder, 381.54 mg of zinc methionine (Met) (equivalent to 80 mg of zinc), or 99.69 mg of zinc oxide (ZO) (equivalent to 80 mg of zinc) in 2 L of a zinc-free oral rehydration solution (ORS). Calves were treated once daily until normal fecal consistency or for a maximum of 14 days. Upon enrollment and exit, calves were weighed, and blood, feces, and liver biopsies were collected for trace mineral analysis. Fecal samples at enrollment and exit were tested for E. coli K99, Cryptosporidium spp., rotavirus and coronavirus. Pre-treatment liver zinc concentrations for the 71 calves in the placebo, zinc Met, and ZO treatment groups were 710.6 (SEM = 147.7), 852.3 (SEM = 129.6), and 750.7 (SEM = 202.9) mg/kg dry weight (DW), respectively. Exit liver zinc concentrations for the calves in the placebo, zinc Met, and ZO treatment groups were 728.9 (SEM = 182.9), 1141.0 (SEM = 423.8), and 636.8 (SEM = 81.5) mg/kg dry weight, respectively. Although statistically non-significant, there were clinically important findings identified for each of zinc Met and ZO treatments. Calves treated with zinc Met gained on average 40 g/day during a diarrhea episode compared to a weight loss of 67 g/day on average in the placebo-treated calves (Power 19.9%). Calves treated with ZO had 1.4 times higher hazard of clinical cure compared to calves in the placebo group (Power 5.3%). Calves that were fecal positive to cryptosporidium spp. at enrollment and treated with zinc Met had higher odds of testing negative at exit compared to placebo calves (Odds Ratio (OR) = 16.0). In contrast, calves treated with ZO tended to recover (fecal score = 1) one day earlier compared to calves treated with a placebo (8.5 d vs. 9.7 d).

There are considerable regulatory challenges to consider in commercialization of plant‐made pharmaceuticals (PMPs), some of which are inherent to plant‐production systems and others that are common with other production systems, but are new to PMPs because of the youth of the industry. In this review, we discuss our recent and ongoing experience with bulk production of the HIV microbicide candidate, griffithsin (GRFT), utilizing plant‐based transient protein expression, with specific focus on areas relevant to commercial manufacturing of bulk GRFT active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Analytical programs have been developed for the qualification and monitoring of both the expression vector system and the API detailing our experience and plans for each. Monitoring postpurification protein modifications are discussed in relation to stability and safety programs. Expression, processing and analytics programs are associated with increased manufacturing costs in current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) production because of the required qualification testing. The impact of these costs on the overall cost of goods is particularly relevant to GRFT manufacturing because GRFT, as an HIV microbicide, is most needed in populations at high risk for HIV exposure in resource‐poor countries. Consequently, GRFT for microbicide applications is a very cost‐sensitive recombinant PMP. We have therefore emphasized maintaining a low cost of goods.

OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that there might be a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated ON development. METHODS: ON rabbit model was induced based on our established protocol. Dynamic-MRI was employed for local intra-osseous perfusion evaluation in bilateral femora. Two weeks after induction, bone marrow was harvested for evaluating the ability of adipogenic differentiation of marrow MSCs at both cellular and mRNA level involving adipogenesis-related gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPARγ2). The bilateral femora were dissected for examining marrow lipid deposition by quantifying fat cell number, fat cell size, lipid deposition area and ON lesions. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON occurrence, the rabbits were divided into ON(+ )(with at least one ON lesion) group and ON(- )(without ON lesion) group. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON extension, the ON(+ )rabbits were further divided into sub-single-lesion group (SON group: with one ON lesion) and sub-multiple-lesion group (MON group: with more than one ON lesion). RESULTS: Local intra-osseous perfusion index was found lower in either ON(+ )or MON group when compared to either ON(- )or SON group, whereas the marrow fat cells number and area were much larger in either ON(+ )or MON group as compared with ON(- )and SON group. The adipogenic differentiation ability of MSCs and PPARγ2 expression in either ON(+ )or MON group were elevated significantly as compared with either ON(- )or SON group. CONCLUSION: These findings support our hypothesis that there is a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated osteonecrosis development.",2007-10-15,"Sheng, Hui H; Zhang, Ge G; Cheung, Wing Hoi WH; Chan, Chun Wai CW; Wang, Yi Xiang YX; Lee, Kwong Man KM; Wang, Hong Fu HF; Leung, Kwok Sui KS; Qin, Ling L",J Orthop Surg,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/296e24d0dc3c17633eeffea57bd23e968a1c8a5e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2146995.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17937789/,1861402

JHMV can remain up to 20 days in the latent state and about 14 days before the cultures lose the capacity to resume virus production upon return to 32.5°C. Although persistently and latently infected RN2-2 cells display resistance to superinfection by a heterologous agent VSV, these cells do not release detectable soluble mediators (e.g., interferon) of the antiviral state. Nevertheless, RN2-2 cells are competent to synthesize and release interferon when treated with the appropriate inducers. These observations suggest that interferon does not play any role or may not be the major factor in the control of latency in the Schwannoma cell. Hybridization with virus-specific cDNAs shows that all viral mRNAs are present during latency and that viral mRNAs are present in the polysomes of infected cells at 39.5°C.

Although it is well tolerated by most patients and helps in the achievement of complete remission, a few rare imatinib-associated adverse effects such as pulmonary interstitial fibrosis have been reported. Because of its rareity, the clinical features of imatinib-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) remain unclear. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 49-year-old Chinese man with chronic myeloid leukemia received oral treatment with imatinib and initially exhibited a good response. However, he presented with cough and fever 9 months after treatment initiation. DIAGNOSES: Pulmonary computed tomography indicated diffuse interstitial fibrosis in both lungs. All tests for possible infectious pathologies provided negative results. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia and treated with antibiotics; however, there was no improvement. On the basis of a suspicion of imatinib-induced ILD, imatinib was discontinued and prednisone treatment was initiated. OUTCOMES: The patient's symptoms ameliorated with treatment, and imatinib was reintroduced. However, he developed cough and dyspnea again, and his treatment was switched to nilotinib as a second-line regimen. He was regularly monitored, and although his clinical symptoms ameliorated, computed tomography performed 29 months after he was diagnosed with ILD showed irreversible pulmonary interstitial fibrosis without progression. LESSONS: Clinicians should consider the possibility of severe irreversible ILD and carefully monitor patients receiving imatinib treatment.",2019-02-22,"Zhang, Ping; Huang, Jingfeng; Jin, Fangfang; Pan, Jiaohai; Ouyang, Guifang",Medicine (Baltimore),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e8c88bae765a67eb93e119820caa702994e13c1d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6407980.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813141/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000014402,73473464

Furthermore, antivirals are not invariably effective in severe influenza, such as that caused by H5N1 viruses. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop alternative therapeutic strategies. Here, we show that human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells expanded by the aminobisphosphonate pamidronate (PAM) kill influenza virus–infected cells and inhibit viral replication in vitro. In Rag2(−/−)γc(−/−) immunodeficient mice reconstituted with human peripheral mononuclear cells (huPBMCs), PAM reduces disease severity and mortality caused by human seasonal H1N1 and avian H5N1 influenza virus, and controls the lung inflammation and viral replication. PAM has no such effects in influenza virus–infected Rag2(−/−)γc(−/−) mice reconstituted with Vγ9Vδ2 T cell–depleted huPBMCs. Our study provides proof-of-concept of a novel therapeutic strategy for treating influenza by targeting the host rather than the virus, thereby reducing the opportunity for the emergence of drug-resistant viruses.

When TBI was reduced to 1 Gy, only transient engraftment was observed. Here we investigated whether stable engraftment after 1-Gy TBI could be accomplished by reducing host-versus-donor immune responsiveness through preceding CD154 blockade and infusion of donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We found that the anti-human CD154 antibody, 5c8, cross-reacted with canine lymphocytes and blocked alloimmune responses in vitro. Based on pharmacokinetic studies, 6 dogs received a single intravenous injection of 5 mg/kg anti-CD154 antibody (on day −5), followed 1 day later by donor PBMCs. On day 0, the dogs were given 1 Gy of TBI and underwent DLA-identical marrow grafts. Postgraft immunosuppression consisted of MMF and CSP. All 6 dogs demonstrated initial engraftment; 3 dogs sustained the engraftment for >26 weeks, whereas 3 dogs rejected their grafts, after 9, 22, and 24 weeks, and survived with autologous recovery. Graft survival was significantly improved over that in 11 historical controls conditioned with 1-Gy TBI and given either MMF or rapamycin with CSP after HCT, all of which rejected their grafts between 3 and 12 weeks (P = .03).

We investigated the performance of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on blood in the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia among children from 7 low- and middle-income countries. METHODS. We tested blood by PCR for the pneumococcal autolysin gene in children aged 1–59 months in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study. Children had World Health Organization–defined severe or very severe pneumonia or were age-frequency–matched community controls. Additionally, we tested blood from general pediatric admissions in Kilifi, Kenya, a PERCH site. The proportion PCR-positive was compared among cases with microbiologically confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia (MCPP), cases without a confirmed bacterial infection (nonconfirmed), cases confirmed for nonpneumococcal bacteria, and controls. RESULTS. In PERCH, 7.3% (n = 291/3995) of cases and 5.5% (n = 273/4987) of controls were blood pneumococcal PCR-positive (P < .001), compared with 64.3% (n = 36/56) of MCPP cases and 6.3% (n = 243/3832) of nonconfirmed cases (P < .001). Blood pneumococcal PCR positivity was higher in children from the 5 African countries (5.5%–11.5% among cases and 5.3%–10.2% among controls) than from the 2 Asian countries (1.3% and 1.0% among cases and 0.8% and 0.8% among controls). Among Kilifi general pediatric admissions, 3.9% (n = 274/6968) were PCR-positive, including 61.7% (n = 37/60) of those with positive blood cultures for pneumococcus. DISCUSSION. The utility of pneumococcal PCR on blood for diagnosing childhood pneumococcal pneumonia in the 7 low- and middle-income countries studied is limited by poor specificity and by poor sensitivity among MCPP cases.",2017-06-15,"Morpeth, Susan C.; Deloria Knoll, Maria; Scott, J.

It demonstrates that the WHO’s International Health Regulations (IHR) articulate a space of global circulation that exhibits two features. First, the infrastructures of microbial traffic become the primary matters of concern. The IHR do not focus on human life so much as they aim at securing transnational mobilities. Second, the IHR circumscribe a space that is fragmented by zones of intensified governmental control at transportational nodal points, such as airports and harbours. In these zones, technologies of screening and quarantine are applied to modulate the connectivity of people, organic matter and things.

As a result, there has been considerable economic distress globally and a significant loss of life. Sadly, the vulnerable and immunocompromised in our societies seem to be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 complications. Global public health bodies and governments have ignited strategies and issued advisories on various handwashing and hygiene guidelines, social distancing strategies, and, in the most extreme cases, some countries have adopted “stay in place” or lockdown protocols to prevent COVID-19 spread. Notably, there are several significant risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection. These include the presence of poor nutritional status and pre-existing noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes mellitus, chronic lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), obesity, and various other diseases that render the patient immunocompromised. These diseases are characterized by systemic inflammation, which may be a common feature of these NCDs, affecting patient outcomes against COVID-19. In this review, we discuss some of the anti-inflammatory therapies that are currently under investigation intended to dampen the cytokine storm of severe COVID-19 infections. Furthermore, nutritional status and the role of diet and lifestyle is considered, as it is known to affect patient outcomes in other severe infections and may play a role in COVID-19 infection.

APN participates in tumor cell expansion and motility, and is a target for cancer therapies. Small drugs that bind to the APN active site inhibit catalysis and suppress tumor growth. APN is also a major cell entry receptor for coronavirus, which binds to a region distant from the active site. Three crystal structures that we determined of human and pig APN ectodomains defined the dynamic conformation of the protein. These structures offered snapshots of closed, intermediate and open APN, which represent distinct functional states. Coronavirus envelope proteins specifically recognized the open APN form, prevented ectodomain progression to the closed form and substrate hydrolysis. In addition, drugs that bind the active site inhibited both coronavirus binding to cell surface APN and infection; the drugs probably hindered APN transition to the virus-specific open form. We conclude that allosteric inhibition of APN functions occurs by ligand suppression of ectodomain motions necessary for catalysis and virus cell entry, as validated by locking APN with disulfides. Blocking APN dynamics can thus be a valuable approach to development of drugs that target this ectoenzyme.",2017-04-10,"Santiago, César; Mudgal, Gaurav; Reguera, Juan; Recacha, Rosario; Albrecht, Sébastien; Enjuanes, Luis; Casasnovas, José M.",Sci Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/306840cf9baaaf3a2e493a39f3ebd67529b8cb2a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5385526.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28393915/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep46045,10115552

Objectives In order to find drugs that treat coronavirus infections, including SARS, we screened traditional medicinal herbal extracts and evaluated their antiviral activities on coronavirus replication. Study design We employed a plaque assay to evaluate the effect of 22 medicinal herbal extracts on virus replication. We determined the 50% effective concentration (EC50) of each extract that was necessary to inhibit the replication of mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59); we also determined 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) for each extract. Northern and Western blot analyzes were performed to investigate antiviral activity in MHV-infected DBT cells, including virus entry, viral RNA and protein expression, and virus release. Coronavirus specific inhibition was also demonstrated using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Results Cimicifuga rhizoma, Meliae cortex, Coptidis rhizoma, Phellodendron cortex and Sophora subprostrata radix decreased the MHV production and the intracellular viral RNA and protein expression with EC50 values ranging from 2.0 to 27.5μg/ml.

Many new aetiological agents have been described recently. Objectives We looked for respiratory viruses in a population‐based sample of healthy adults with influenza‐like illness (ILI). We investigated host and spatio‐temporal associations with virus isolation and host, spatio‐temporal and virus associations with self‐reported symptoms. Patients/Methods We recruited 586 participants experiencing 651 illness episodes from a population of healthy adults enrolled in an influenza vaccine effectiveness trial. At ILI assessment visits, a respiratory swab was collected and tested for viruses using a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Participants also completed a questionnaire detailing their clinical course in 336 episodes. Results Of 643 samples analysed, a virus was identified in 44%. Half were picornaviruses, with influenza and coronaviruses the next most common. Individuals with influenza were significantly less likely to have been immunised than the reference (virus negative) population (OR = 0·52 (0·31, 0·87) P = 0·01). The mean symptom score (95% CI) reported by individuals with influenza was significantly higher than in all other episodes [Influenza: 10·2 (9·4, 10·9); Other: 7·4 (7·2, 7·7); Difference (95% CI): 2·5 (1·5, 3·5); P < 0·001]. In an analysis restricted to influenza‐positive cases, the symptom score was not attenuated by vaccination.

As PBB shares common features with other pediatric conditions, further characterization is needed to improve diagnostic accuracy among clinicians. In this study, we aim to further delineate the clinical and laboratory features of PBB in a larger cohort, with a specific focus on concurrent viral detection. Methods Children with and without PBB (control subjects) undergoing flexible bronchoscopy were prospectively recruited. Basic immune function testing and lymphocyte subset analyses were performed. BAL specimens were processed for cellularity and microbiology. Viruses were identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bacteria were identified via culture. Results The median age of the 104 children (69% male) with PBB was 19 months (interquartile range [IQR], 12-30 mo). Compared with control subjects, children with PBB were more likely to have attended childcare (OR, 8.43; 95% CI, 2.34-30.46). High rates of wheeze were present in both groups, and tracheobronchomalacia was common. Children with PBB had significantly elevated percentages of neutrophils in the lower airways compared with control subjects, and adenovirus was more likely to be detected in BAL specimens in those with PBB (OR, 6.69; 95% CI, 1.50-29.80). Median CD56 and CD16 natural killer (NK) cell levels in blood were elevated for age in children with PBB (0.7 × 109/L; IQR, 0.5-0.9 cells/L). Conclusions Children with PBB are, typically, very young boys with prolonged wet cough and parent-reported wheeze who have attended childcare. Coupled with elevated NK-cell levels, the association between adenovirus and PBB suggests a likely role of viruses in PBB pathogenesis.",2014-06-30,"Wurzel, Danielle F.; Marchant, Julie M.; Yerkovich, Stephanie T.; Upham, John W.; Mackay, Ian M.; Masters, I.

Objective: To compare the plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentrations in ribavirin-treated patients who received early hydrocortisone therapy with those who received placebo. Study design: Serial plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentrations measured in the setting of a prospective, randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of “early” (<7 days of illness) hydrocortisone use in previously healthy SARS patients were analyzed. SARS-CoV RNA was quantified using a one-step real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the nucleocapsid gene. Results: Among 16 non-ICU cases, SARS-CoV RNA was detected in plasma since day 3–4 after fever onset; viral concentration peaked in the first week, which then rapidly declined in the second week of illness. On days 8, 12, 16, and 20, the cumulative proportion of patients with undetectable virus in plasma was 31%, 69%, 92%, and 100%, respectively.

In this work we focus on the evolution of the COVID-19 in one of the most populous Brazilian states, namely the Rio de Janeiro state. The first case was reported in March 5, 2020, thus we have a considerable amount of available data to make a good analysis. We study the dynamics of COVID-19 through a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model with an additional mechanism that represents the implementation of public policies of social isolation. Based on the data collected from the Rio de Janeiro state Department of Health from March 5, 2020 through April 26, 2020, we observed that the implementation of social distancing policies changed the initial exponential growth to a sub-exponential one. The SIQR model with the above-mentioned mechanism is capable of reproducing the data of confirmed cases in Rio de Janeiro, and it explains how that change occurred. The model also predicts an important mitigation effect, namely the flattening effect, i.e., the considerably decrease of the maximum number of confirmed cases. Through the results of the model, this effect can be directly related to the social isolation policies.

In those studies, RV-C has been associated with more severe respiratory tract infections than RV species A and B. In this study we determined the frequency and diversity of RV strains associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URTI, LRTI) in Mexico, and describe the clinical characteristics of the illness associated with different RV species. METHODS: A prospective surveillance of 526 and 250 children with URTI and LRTI was carried out. Respiratory samples were analyzed by RT-PCR for viruses. The 5′ untranslated region of the RV genome was amplified and sequenced. RESULTS: In the case of URTI, 17.5% were positive for RV, while this virus was found in 24.8% of LRTI. The RV species was determined in 73 children with URTI: 61.6% were RV-A, 37% RV-C and, 1.4% RV-B; and in 43 children with LRTI: 51.2% were RV-A, 41.8% RV-C, and 7% RV-B. No significant differences in clinical characteristics were found in patients with RV-A or RV-C infections. A high genetic diversity of RV strains was found in both URTI and LRTI.

In an effort to determine which viral proteins might be determinants of enterotropism, immunoblots of MHV-Y and MHV-RI virions using anti-S, -N and -M protein-specific antisera were performed. The uncleaved MHV-Y and MHV-RI S proteins migrated slightly faster than the MHV-A59 S protein. The MHV-Y S protein was inefficiently cleaved. The MHV-Y, MHV-RI and MHV-A59 N and M proteins showed only minor differences in their migration. The S genes of MHV-Y and MHV-RI were cloned, sequenced and found to encode 1361 and 1376 amino acid long proteins, respectively. The presence of several amino acids changes upstream from the predicted cleavage site of the MHV-Y S protein may contribute its inefficient cleavage. A high degree of homology was found between the MHV-RI and MHV-4 S proteins, whereas the homology between the MHV-Y S protein and the S proteins of other MHV strains was much lower.

METHODS: We applied machine learning techniques to clinical data from a large cohort of 5,051 COVID-19 patients treated at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, the global COVID-19 epicenter, to predict mortality. Predictors were designed to classify patients into Deceased or Alive mortality classes and were evaluated in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC score). FINDINGS: Using a development cohort (n=3,841) and a systematic machine learning framework, we identified a COVID-19 mortality predictor that demonstrated high accuracy (AUC=0·91) when applied to test sets of retrospective (n= 961) and prospective (n=249) patients. This mortality predictor was based on five clinical features: age, minimum O(2) saturation during encounter, type of patient encounter (inpatient vs. various types of outpatient and telehealth encounters), hydroxychloroquine use, and maximum body temperature.

Other poorly characterized protein based antiviral mechanisms also contribute to the control of viral replication in insects. In addition, it remains unclear whether tissue specific factors contribute to RNA and protein-based antiviral immunity mechanisms. In vivo screens to identify such factors are challenging and time consuming. In addition, the scored phenotype is usually limited to survival and/or viral load. Transgenic viral replicons are valuable tools to overcome these limitations and screen for novel antiviral factors. Here we describe transgenic Drosophila melanogaster lines encoding a Flock House Virus-derived replicon (FHV∆B2eGFP), expressing GFP as a reporter of viral replication. This replicon is efficiently controlled by the siRNA pathway in most somatic tissues, with GFP fluorescence providing a reliable marker for the activity of antiviral RNAi. Interestingly, in follicular somatic cells (FSC) of ovaries, this replicon is still partially repressed in an siRNA independent manner.

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), belonging to gamma-coronaviruses, causes a highly infectious respiratory viral disease and can result in catastrophic economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. Unfortunately, the genetic basis of the host immune responses against IBV is poorly understood. In the present study, the antibody levels against IBV post-immunization were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the serum of 511 individuals from a commercial chicken (Gallus gallus) population. A genome-wide association study using 43,211 single nucleotide polymorphism markers was performed to identify the major loci affecting the immune response against IBV. This study detected 20 significant (P <1.16×10−6) effect single nucleotide polymorphisms for the antibody level against IBV. These single nucleotide polymorphisms were distributed on five chicken chromosomes (GGA), involving GGA1, GGA3, GGA5, GGA8, and GGA9. The genes in the 1-Mb windows surrounding each single nucleotide polymorphism with significant effect for the antibody level against IBV were associated with many biological processes or pathways related to immunity, such as the defense response and mTOR signaling pathway. A genomic region containing a cluster of 13 beta-defensin (GAL1–13) and interleukin-17F genes on GGA3 probably plays an important role in the immune response against IBV. In addition, the major loci significantly associated with the antibody level against IBV on GGA1 and GGA5 could explain about 12% and 13% of the phenotypic variation, respectively. This study suggested that the chicken genome has several important loci affecting the immune response against IBV, and increases our knowledge of how to control outbreaks of infectious bronchitis.",2014-01-31,"Luo, Chenglong; Qu, Hao; Ma, Jie; Wang, Jie; Hu, Xiaoxiang; Li, Ning; Shu, Dingming","Infection, Genetics and Evolution",,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4939a8ffb831e245e793678ca58921a9cea68872.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106259.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134813004474; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134813004474; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2013.12.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24333371/,36729923

Disruptions in the drug market are expected and shortages might worsen. Community pharmacies can contribute to early identification and report of medicines’ supply and demand issues. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on outpatient medicines’ sales and shortages. METHODS: A retrospective, time-trend analysis of medicine sales, shortages and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases was performed from February 1st to April 30th, 2020, and its homologous period (regarding sales only). A detailed analysis of 6 pharmaceutical substances was performed. All data were subjected to rescaling using the min-max normalization method, in order to become comparable. Data analysis was performed using Microsoft® Excel. RESULTS: The pandemic resulted in an increase in medicines’ demand and reported shortages during the early stage of the outbreak. The maximum proportion of medicine sales was registered on March 13th, 2020, 4 days after the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. By the end of March, sales have already dropped to proportions similar to those of 2019. The maximum proportion of drug shortages was reached about one week after the sales peak and by the end of the study period were below those recorded in the pre-COVID-19 period. The analyzed drugs were paracetamol, ascorbic acid, dapagliflozin plus metformin, rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe, formoterol, and hydroxychloroquine, as these pharmaceutical substances registered the highest growth rate in sales and shortages when compared to the same period in the previous year. Hydroxychloroquine showed the most different pattern trends on sales and shortages of these medicines. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacies can provide timely and real-world data regarding sales and shortages. The adopted measures to guarantee the continuous supply of the medicine market seem to have worked.

We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis with the objectives of evaluation of safety and efficacy of HCQ alone or in combination in terms of “time to clinical cure,” “virological cure,” “death or clinical worsening of disease,” “radiological progression,” and safety. RevMan was used for meta‐analysis. We searched 16 literature databases out of which seven studies (n = 1358) were included in the systematic review. In terms of clinical cure, two studies reported possible benefit in “time to body temperature normalization” and one study reported less “cough days” in the HCQ arm.

On the other hand, no experimental model has been developed with NTEC strains producing the cytotoxic necrotising factor 2. In all, 14 colostrum-restricted calves were orally challenged with two strains isolated from the faeces of a diarrheic calf (B20a) or from the heart blood of a septicaemic calf (1404). All calves had diarrhoea which lasted until euthanasia in eight of them. In those calves, diarrhoea was correlated with the faecal excretion of the challenge strains. At necropsy, vascular congestion of the intestinal mucosa, hypertrophy of the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and some congestion of the lungs were observed. Bacteriology confirmed the colonisation of the intestine by the challenge strains which were also recovered from the heart blood, the lungs and/or the liver. Histological sections confirmed enterocolitis, lymphadenitis and limited bronchopneumonia. In the intestinal tissue sections, bacteria testing positive in an in situ DNA hybridisation assay with a CNF2 probe were observed. Those results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry with a polyclonal anti-O78 and a monoclonal anti-F17b antisera. Three of the five control calves receiving either saline or a CNF−, F17a strain (25KH09) had no clinical signs or lesions. The other two presented a profuse liquid diarrhoea but those calves were positive for the presence of K99+ E. coli.

As some live recombinant vectored vaccines may be replication-competent, a key challenge is defining the length of time for monitoring potential adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in clinical trials and epidemiologic studies. This time period must be chosen with care and based on considerations of pre-clinical and clinical trials data, biological plausibility and practical feasibility. The available options include: (1) adapting from the current relevant regulatory guidelines; (2) convening a panel of experts to review the evidence from a systematic literature search to narrow down a list of likely potential or known AEFI and establish the optimal risk window(s); and (3) conducting “near real-time“ prospective monitoring for unknown clustering’s of AEFI in validated large linked vaccine safety databases using Rapid Cycle Analysis for pre-specified adverse events of special interest (AESI) and Treescan to identify previously unsuspected outcomes.

Two ferrets were subjected to necropsy examination, which revealed pyothorax, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and multiple white nodules (1–2mm) in the lungs. Microscopical examination showed multifocal necrotizing-pyogranulomatous pleuropneumonia and lymphadenitis with aggregates of encapsulated microorganisms, some of which were positively stained by periodic acid–Schiff and alcian blue. In-situ hybridization for Pneumocystis spp., Ziehl–Neelsen staining and immunohistochemistry for distemper, coronavirus and influenza antigen were negative in all cases.

While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyles at home is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020, in seven languages, to elucidate the behavioural and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours. Methods: Following a structured review of the literature, the “Effects of home Confinement on multiple Lifestyle Behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak (ECLB-COVID19)” Electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform. Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Slovenian languages. Questions were presented in a differential format, with questions related to responses “before” and “during” confinement conditions. Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis. The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all PA intensity levels (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall). Additionally, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 h per day. Food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of main meals) were more unhealthy during confinement, with only alcohol binge drinking decreasing significantly. Conclusion: While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a health compromising direction. A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups, which will help develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during the COVID-19 confinement.",2020-05-28,"Ammar, Achraf; Brach, Michael; Trabelsi, Khaled; Chtourou, Hamdi; Boukhris, Omar; Masmoudi, Liwa; Bouaziz, Bassem; Bentlage, Ellen; How, Daniella; Ahmed, Mona; Müller, Patrick; Müller, Notger; Aloui, Asma; Hammouda, Omar; Paineiras-Domingos, Laisa Liane; Braakman-Jansen, Annemarie; Wrede, Christian; Bastoni, Sofia; Pernambuco, Carlos Soares; Mataruna, Leonardo; Taheri, Morteza; Irandoust, Khadijeh; Khacharem, Aïmen; Bragazzi, Nicola L.; Chamari, Karim; Glenn, Jordan M.; Bott, Nicholas T.; Gargouri, Faiez; Chaari, Lotfi; Batatia, Hadj; Ali, Gamal Mohamed; Abdelkarim, Osama; Jarraya, Mohamed; El Abed, Kais; Souissi, Nizar; Van Gemert-Pijnen, Lisette; Riemann, Bryan L.; Riemann, Laurel; Moalla, Wassim; Gómez-Raja, Jonathan; Epstein, Monique; Sanderman, Robbert; Schulz, Sebastian V.

U-HR-CT has a larger matrix size of 1024 × 1024 thinner slice thickness of 0.25 mm and can demonstrate terminal bronchioles in the normal lungs; as a result, Reid’s secondary lobules and their abnormalities can be identified. The distribution and hallmarks (ground-glass opacity, consolidation with or without architectural distortion, linear opacity, crazy paving) of the lung opacities on U-HRCT were visually evaluated on a 1 K monitor by two experienced reviewers. The CT lung volume was measured, and the ratio of the measured lung volume to the predicted total lung capacity (predTLC) based on sex, age and height was calculated. RESULTS: All cases showed crazy paving pattern in U-HRCT. In these lesions, the secondary lobules were smaller than those in the un-affected lungs. CT lung volume decreased in two cases comparing predTLC.

To date, little is known about the viral shedding duration, clinical course, and treatment efficacy of COVID‐19 near Hubei Province, China. This multicentre, retrospective study was performed in 12 hospitals in Henan and Shaanxi Provinces from January 20 to February 8, 2020. Clinical outcomes were followed up until March 26, 2020. The viral shedding duration, full clinical course, and treatment efficacy were analysed in different subgroups of patients. A total of 149 COVID‐19 patients were enrolled. The median age was 42 years, and 61.1% (91) were males. Of them, 133 (89.3%) had fever, 131 of 144 (91%) had pneumonia, 27 (18.1%) required intensive care unit (ICU) management, 3 (2%) were pregnant, and 3 (2%) died. Two premature newborns were negative for SARS‐CoV‐2. In total, the median SARS‐CoV‐2 shedding period and clinical course were 12 (IQR: 9‐17; mean: 13.4, 95% CI: 12.5, 14.2) and 20 (IQR: 16‐24; mean: 21.2, 95% CI: 20.1, 22.3) days, respectively; and ICU patients had longer median viral shedding periods (21 [17‐24] vs 11 [9‐15]) and clinical courses (30 [22‐33] vs 19 [15.8‐22]) than non‐ICU patients (both p<0.0001). SARS‐CoV‐2 clearances occurred at least 2 days before fatality in 3 non‐survivors. Current treatment with any antiviral agent or combination did not present the benefit of shortening viral shedding period and clinical course (all p>0.05) in real‐life settings. In conclusion, the viral shedding duration and clinical course in Henan and Shaanxi Provinces were shorter than those in Hubei Province, and current antiviral therapies were ineffective for shortening viral shedding duration and clinical course in real‐world settings.

Objectives This study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics of children with HMPV infection admitted to paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) across the United Kingdom (UK) over a nine-year period and to estimate the associated costs of care. Study design Data were collected from the UK paediatric intensive care audit network (PICANet) and costs calculated using the National Health Service (NHS) reference costing scheme. Results There were 114 admissions in which HMPV was detected. The number of admissions associated with a code of HMPV rose steadily over the study period (three in 2006 to 28 in 2014) and showed significant seasonal variability, with the peak season being from November to May. Children required varying levels of intensive care support from minimal to complex support including invasive ventilation, inotropes, renal replacement therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). HMPV was associated with five deaths during the study period. The associated costs of PICU admissions were estimated to be between £2,256,823 and £3,997,823 over the study period, with estimated annual costs rising over the study period due to increasing HMPV admissions.

In this paper, an ELISA test for the diagnosis of cat sporotrichosis is proposed, which detects S. schenckii-specific antibodies in feline sera. Two different kinds of antigens were used: “SsCBF”, a specific molecule from S. schenckii that consists of a Con A-binding fraction derived from a peptido-rhamnomannan component of the cell wall, and a S. schenckii crude exoantigen preparation. The ELISA was developed, optimized, and evaluated using sera from 30 cats with proven sporotrichosis (by culture isolation); 22 sera from healthy feral cats from a zoonosis center were used as negative controls. SsCBF showed 90% sensitivity and 96% specificity in ELISA; while crude exoantigens demonstrated 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity. The ELISA assay described here would be a valuable screening tool for the detection of specific S. schenckii antibodies in cats with sporotrichosis. The assay is inexpensive, quick to perform, easy to interpret, and permits the diagnosis of feline sporotrichosis.",2011-01-27,"Fernandes, Geisa Ferreira; Lopes-Bezerra, Leila Maria; Bernardes-Engemann, Andréa Reis; Schubach, Tânia Maria Pacheco; Dias, Maria Adelaide Galvão; Pereira, Sandro Antonio; Camargo, Zoilo Pires de",Vet Microbiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/bbadd168f7dce1426d36dc47a6fafff31638ae73.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125942.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20708355/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113510003421; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.07.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113510003421,39852488

There are uncertainties regarding whether there will be a pandemic, if it will be caused by the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus, when or where it will occur, how imminent or how severe it will be. No one can accurately predict if and when a given virus will become a pandemic virus. Pandemic prevention strategies must be based on preparing for the unexpected and being capable of reacting accordingly. There is growing evidence that infection control measures were helpful in containment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as well as avian influenza. Compliance of standard infection control measures, intensive promotion of hand and respiratory hygiene, vigilance and triage of patients with febrile illness, and specific infection control measures are key components to contain a highly contagious disease in hospital and to protect healthcare workers, patients and visitors. The importance of standard precautions for any patient and cleaning and disinfection for the healthcare environment cannot be overemphasized. SARS illustrated dramatically the potential of air travel and globalization for the dissemination of an emerging infectious disease. To prevent the potential serious consequences of pandemic influenza, timely implementation of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions locally within the outbreak area is the key to minimizing global spread.

These molecules are able to directly inhibit many viruses such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Dengue Virus, Ebola Virus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus through binding to envelope protein N-glycans. In the case of HIV, it has been shown that CBAs select for mutant viruses with N-glycosylation site deletions which are more sensitive to neutralizing antibodies. In this study we aimed at evaluating the HCV resistance to CBAs in vitro. HCV was cultivated in the presence of increasing Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA), Cyanovirin-N, Concanavalin-A or Griffithsin concentrations, during more than eight weeks. At the end of lectin exposure, the genome of the isolated strains was sequenced and several potential resistance mutations in the E1E2 envelope glycoproteins were identified. The effect of these mutations on viral fitness as well as on sensitivity to inhibition by lectins, soluble CD81 or the 3/11 neutralizing antibody was assessed. Surprisingly, none of these mutations, alone or in combination, conferred resistance to CBAs. In contrast, we observed that some mutants were more sensitive to 3/11 or CD81-LEL inhibition. Additionally, several mutations were identified in the Core and the non-structural proteins. Thus, our results suggest that in contrast to HIV, HCV resistance to CBAs is not directly conferred by mutations in the envelope protein genes but could occur through an indirect mechanism involving mutations in other viral proteins. Further investigations are needed to completely elucidate the underlying mechanisms.",2016-02-12,"Izquierdo, Laure; Oliveira, Catarina; Fournier, Carole; Descamps, Véronique; Morel, Virginie; Dubuisson, Jean; Brochot, Etienne; Francois, Catherine; Castelain, Sandrine; Duverlie, Gilles; Helle, Francois",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ad60294d191a68f9db374d7ec49f42c2303b3b00.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4752358.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26871442/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0149064,16951763

The bifidobacterial population in milk has been attributed to the existence of prebiotic oat in feeding systems. Since breast feeding protects the newborns against several infectious diseases, milk from sows fed with oat could improve the health of piglets. ABSTRACT: The objectives of this study were to (i) investigate the impact of feeding oat on the population of bifidobacteria and (ii) evaluate their probiotic potential. In this study, we investigated the effects of supplementing sows’ gestation and lactation feed with 15% oat (prebiotic source) on the levels of probiotic population in milk. We found that dietary inclusion of oat during lactation and gestation resulted in increased levels of bifidobacteria compared to lactobacilli in sow milk. Furthermore bifidobacteria within the sow milk samples were further evaluated for probiotic potential based on aggregating properties, and acid- and bile-tolerance after exposure to hydrochloric acid (pH 2.5) and bile salts (0%, 0.25%, 0.50%, 1.0% and 2.0%). All isolates survived under the condition of low pH and bile 2.0%. Autoaggregation ability ranged from 17.5% to 73%. These isolates also showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli O157:H7.

Initial reports find that many of the children are PCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2, so it is difficult to confirm whether this syndrome is a late complication of viral infection in an age group largely spared the worst consequences of this infection, or if this syndrome reflects enhanced surveillance. METHODS: Children hospitalised for symptoms consistent with PIMS-TS between 28 April and 8 May 2020, and who were PCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2, were tested for antibodies to viral spike glycoprotein using an ELISA test. RESULTS: Eight patients (age range 7–14 years, 63% male) fulfilled case-definition for PIMS-TS during the study period. Six of the eight patients required admission to intensive care. All patients exhibited significant IgG and IgA responses to viral spike glycoprotein. Further assessment showed that the IgG isotypes detected in children with PIMS-TS were of the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses, a distribution similar to that observed in samples from hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients. In contrast, IgG2 and IgG4 were not detected in children or adults. IgM was not detected in children, which contrasts with adult hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients of whom all had positive IgM responses. CONCLUSIONS: Strong IgG antibody responses can be detected in PCR-negative children with PIMS-TS. The low detection rate of IgM in these patients is consistent with infection having occurred weeks previously and that the syndrome onset occurs well after the control of SARS-CoV-2 viral load. This implies that the disease is largely immune-mediated.

AIM: To review the influence of host genetic factors on the clinical course as well as on treatment response in patients with viral hepatitis. METHODS: Review of the literature. RESULTS: A landmark genome‐wide association study (GWAS) identified polymorphisms in the IL28B gene on chromosome 19 (19q13.13) associated with response to therapy with pegylated interferon‐α (PEG‐IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) and spontaneous viral clearance in acute hepatitis C. Furthermore, IL28B genotype is associated with changes of lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. A further GWAS demonstrated that ITPA genetic variants protect HCV genotype 1 patients from RBV‐induced anaemia. Another polymorphism in the patatin‐like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) is associated with hepatic steatosis. Difficult‐to‐treat hepatitis C patients homozygous for GG had an up to five‐fold lower chance of viral clearance on PEG/RBV than non‐GG patients. In chronic hepatitis B patients treated with PEG‐IFN several retrospective analyses of IL28B rs12980275 and rs12979860 genotypes yielded conflicting results which can be explained by the heterogeneity between the study populations. Some variants of the HLA‐DP locus (HLA‐DPA1 A allele and HLA‐DPB1) protect against progression of chronic hepatitis B infection.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic and debilitating inflammatory condition of the urinary bladder characterized by the hallmark symptoms of pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction. To facilitate IC/BPS research, we used transgenic technology to develop a novel urothelial MCP-1 secretion mouse model (URO-MCP-1). A transgene consisting of the uroplakin II gene promoter and the mouse MCP-1 coding sequence with a secretory element was constructed and microinjected. URO-MCP-1 mice were found to express MCP-1 mRNA in the bladder epithelium and MCP-1 protein in the urine, and developed bladder inflammation 24 hours after intravesical administration of a single sub-noxious dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The inflamed bladders of URO-MCP-1 mice exhibited elevated mRNAs for interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-6, substance P precursor, and nerve growth factor as well as increased macrophage infiltration. In parallel with these phenotypic changes, URO-MCP-1 mice manifested significant functional changes at days 1 and 3 after cystitis induction. These functional changes included pelvic pain as measured by von Frey filament stimulation and voiding dysfunction (increased urinary frequency, reduced average volume voided per micturition, and reduced maximum volume voided per micturition) as measured by micturition cages. Micturition changes remained evident at day 7 after cystitis induction, although these changes were not statistically significant. Control wild-type C57BL/6 mice manifested no clear changes in histological, biochemical and behavioral features after similar cystitis induction with LPS.

Besides impacts of habitat changes caused by current rates of land conversion, climatic influences or predators, a contribution of infectious pathogens needs also to be considered. Infectious and non-infectious diseases in free-living populations of ring-necked pheasants have been scarcely investigated so far. In the present study, carcasses of 258 deceased free-ranging pheasants of different age groups, predominantly adult pheasants, collected over a period of 4 years in the states of Lower Saxony, North Rhine–Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein, were examined pathomorphologically, parasitologically, virologically and bacteriologically, with a focus set on infectious pathogens. A periocular and perinasal dermatitis of unknown origin was present in 62.3% of the pheasants. Additional alterations included protozoal cysts in the skeletal musculature (19.0%), hepatitis (21.7%), enteritis (18.7%), gastritis (12.6%), and pneumonia (11.7%).

Between December 2002 and May 2003, patients hospitalized due to an exacerbation of COPD were identified. Nasopharyngeal specimens obtained from these patients were tested for human metapneumovirus by RT–PCR and for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza-1, -2, and -3 and adenovirus by a cytospin-enhanced direct immunofluorescence assay and/or viral culture. RESULTS: Fifty individuals met enrollment criteria and hMPV was identified in 6 (12%), respiratory syncytial virus in 4 (8%), influenza A in 2 (4%) and parainfluenza type 3 in 1 (2%) patients.

The assay involves amplification of target nucleic acid using random primers followed by in vitro transcription whose cRNA product is labeled chemically, fragmented and used as target for hybridization. Initial optimization tests with Turnip vein clearing virus and Cauliflower mosaic virus showed increased hybridization efficiency with shorter cDNA targets (100 bp) and longer probes (50 and 70 nt). The system was validated in pure and mixed samples by detection of three Tymovirus species: Asclepias asymptomatic virus, Kennedya yellow mosaic virus and Turnip yellow mosaic virus.

In this present study, we developed a detection system of microbes from porcine respiratory by using TaqMan real-time PCR (referred to as Dempo-PCR) to screen a broad range of pathogens associated with porcine respiratory diseases in a single run. We selected 17 porcine respiratory pathogens (Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Boldetella bronchiseptica, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella multocida toxin, Streptococcus suis, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Mycoplasma hyosynovie, porcine circovirus 2, pseudorabies virus, porcine cytomegalovirus, swine influenza A virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus US strain, EU strain, porcine respiratory coronavirus and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) as detection targets and designed novel specific primer-probe sets for seven of them. In sensitivity test by using standard curves from synthesized DNA, all primer-probe sets showed high sensitivity. However, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus is known to have a high frequency of genetic mutations, and the primer and probe sequences will need to be checked at a considerable frequency when performing Dempo-PCR from field samples. A total of 30 lung samples from swine showing respiratory symptoms on six farms were tested by the Dempo-PCR to validate the assay’s clinical performance. As the results, 12 pathogens (5 virus and 7 bacteria) were detected and porcine reproductive and respiratory virus US strain, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Haemophilus parasuis, and porcine cytomegalovirus were detected at high frequency.

In the province of British Columbia, the Ministry of Health initiated a collaborative evidence-informed process involving a steering committee of representatives from the six health authorities. A Core Functions (CF) Framework was developed, identifying 21 core public health programs. For each core program, an evidence review was conducted and a model core program paper developed. These documents were distributed to health authorities to guide development of their own renewed public health services. The CF implementation was conceptualized as an embedded knowledge translation process. A CF coordinator in each health authority was to facilitate a gap analysis and development of a performance improvement plan for each core program, and post these publically on the health authority website. METHODS: Interviews (n = 19) and focus groups (n = 8) were conducted with a total of 56 managers and front line staff from five health authorities working in the Healthy Living and Sexually Transmitted Infection Prevention core programs. All interviews and focus groups were digitally recorded, transcribed and verified by the project coordinator. Five members of the research team used NVivo 9 to manage data and conducted a thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged concerning implementation of the CF Framework generally, and the two programs specifically. The themes were: ‘you’ve told me what, now tell me how’; ‘the double bind’; ‘but we already do that’; and the ‘selling game.’ Findings demonstrate the original vision of the CF process was lost in the implementation process and many participants were unaware of the CF framework or process. CONCLUSIONS: Results are discussed with respect to a well-known framework on the adoption, assimilation, and implementation of innovations in health services organizations. Despite attempts of the Ministry of Health and the Steering Committee to develop and implement a collaborative, evidence-informed policy intervention, there were several barriers to the realization of the vision for core public health functions implementation, at least in the early stages. In neglecting the implementation process, it seems unlikely that the expected benefits of the public health renewal process will be realized.",2013-06-04,"Tomm-Bonde, Laura; Schreiber, Rita S; Allan, Diane E; MacDonald, Marjorie; Pauly, Bernie; Hancock, Trevor",Implement Sci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c9d84fcde35a82c200f779df24657558638bf40b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3680003.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23734672/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1748-5908-8-59,12255450

It has now been clearly demonstrated that SARS-CoV‑2 resides in the upper airways and transmits easily via aerosols and droplets, which significantly increases the risk of infection when performing upper airway procedures. Ventilated COVID-19 patients in a critical condition in the intensive care unit may require tracheotomy for long-term ventilation and to improve weaning. However, the risk of secondary infection of medical personnel performing subsequent tracheostomy care remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the risk of droplet dispersion during tracheostomy tube change and overview tracheostomy tube change in COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current literature was reviewed, quantitative and qualitative analyses of droplet formation during tracheostomy tube change in n = 8 patients were performed, and an overview of and checklist for tracheostomy tube change were compiled. RESULTS: This study demonstrates that tracheostomy tube change, in particular insertion of the new tube, may cause significant droplet formation. The aerosolization of particles smaller than 5 µm was not analyzed.

Since PDCoV was first detected in 2009 in Hong Kong, the prevalence of PDCoV has increased in recent years, resulting in serious economic losses to the swine industry. The coronavirus spike (S) protein is an antigen that has been demonstrated to contain epitopes that induce neutralizing antibodies. The presence of serum and milk IgA antibodies against pathogens that replicate primarily on mucosal surfaces is important for mucosal immunity. Here, an indirect anti-PDCoV IgA antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PDCoV S1 IgA ELISA) using the purified S1 portion of S protein as the coating antigen was developed to detect PDCoV IgA antibodies in serum and sow’s milk. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed high specificity and sensitivity of the PDCoV-S1-IgA-ELISA based on samples confirmed by IFA. Anti-PDCoV IgA antibodies in 152 serum samples and 65 milk samples collected from six farms that had experienced diarrhea outbreaks within previous last two years were detected by this assay, and 62.5% of the serum samples and 100% of the milk samples were positive for PDCoV. The indirect ELISA method established in this study will provide a convenient tool for measurement of serum and milk IgA levels against PDCoV in pig herds, rapid detection of PDCoV infection in pigs, and evaluation of the immunogenicity of vaccines.

The healthcare system suffered from a shortage of ICU beds and oxygenation support devices. In our Institution, most patients received chest CT at admission, only interpreted visually. Given the proven value of quantitative CT analysis (QCT) in the setting of ARDS, we tested QCT as an outcome predictor for COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a single-centre retrospective study on COVID-19 patients hospitalised from January 25, 2020, to April 28, 2020, who received CT at admission prompted by respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea or desaturation. QCT was performed using a semi-automated method (3D Slicer). Lungs were divided by Hounsfield unit intervals. Compromised lung (%CL) volume was the sum of poorly and non-aerated volumes (− 500, 100 HU). We collected patient’s clinical data including oxygenation support throughout hospitalisation. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two patients (163 males, median age 66, IQR 54–6) were included; 75% received oxygenation support (20% intubation rate). Compromised lung volume was the most accurate outcome predictor (logistic regression, p < 0.001). %CL values in the 6–23% range increased risk of oxygenation support; values above 23% were at risk for intubation. %CL showed a negative correlation with PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (p < 0.001) and was a risk factor for in-hospital mortality (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: QCT provides new metrics of COVID-19. The compromised lung volume is accurate in predicting the need for oxygenation support and intubation and is a significant risk factor for in-hospital death. QCT may serve as a tool for the triaging process of COVID-19. KEY POINTS: • Quantitative computer-aided analysis of chest CT (QCT) provides new metrics of COVID-19. • The compromised lung volume measured in the − 500, 100 HU interval predicts oxygenation support and intubation and is a risk factor for in-hospital death. • Compromised lung values in the 6–23% range prompt oxygenation therapy; values above 23% increase the need for intubation.",2020-06-26,"Lanza, Ezio; Muglia, Riccardo; Bolengo, Isabella; Santonocito, Orazio Giuseppe; Lisi, Costanza; Angelotti, Giovanni; Morandini, Pierandrea; Savevski, Victor; Politi, Letterio Salvatore; Balzarini, Luca",Eur Radiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c9cb44e690ea5d280530e85f705dbbd8fd2ab13c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7317888.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32591888/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07013-2,220064089

A total of 450 ovines (250 sheep and 200 lambs) and 140 bovines (130 cows and 10 calves) were housed in two separated units, at the time of the outbreak. About half of the lambs had diarrhea due to Cryptosporidium sp. with a mortality rate of 80%; calves were not infected. Genomic DNA was extracted from an archived slide and from fecal specimens, and the parasite was identified as Cryptosporidium parvum by PCR and sequence analysis at the CpA135 gene. Genotyping at the GP60 gene showed the presence of a very rare genotype, IIaA20G2R1. Shortly after the outbreak was identified, the son of the farm's owner, aged 18 months, experienced an acute gastroenteritis and was hospitalized due to recurrent episodes of diarrhea, fever, vomiting and lack of appetite. The feces tested negative for bacteria and viruses, whereas cryptosporidiosis was diagnosed by microscopy and an immunochromatographic test.

Moreover, arenaviruses pose a biodefense threat. No licensed anti-arenavirus vaccines are available, and current anti-arenavirus therapy is limited to the use of ribavirin, which is only partially effective and is associated with anemia and other side effects. Therefore, it is important to develop effective vaccines and better antiviral drugs to combat the dual threats of naturally occurring and intentionally introduced arenavirus infections. The development of arenavirus reverse genetic systems is allowing investigators to conduct a detailed molecular characterization of the viral cis-acting signals and trans-acting factors that control each of the steps of the arenavirus life cycle, including RNA synthesis, packaging and budding. Knowledge derived from these studies is uncovering potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention, as well as facilitating the establishment of assays to identify and characterize candidate antiviral drugs capable of interfering with specific steps of the virus life cycle.

The opposite was true for cleaning of the lambing areas, organization of lambing periods, accumulation of lambs in the pens, high content of fat, protein and lactose in milk and low serum gamma globulin and total protein in lambs and ewes. Cryptosporidium spp. and Escherichia coli isolation showed a trend to be linked to the presence of diarrhoea. A positive correlation was found between serum total protein in ewes and serum gamma globulin in lambs.

There is no respite in sight as of now as the numbers continue to increase exponentially with each passing day. The only possible control to the virus is the availability of a vaccine, which will take a few months to be available to masses.

Given that BCoV is better studied than equine coronaviruses and given the possibility of interspecies transmission of these viruses, this research was designed to compare the partial sequences of the spike glycoprotein (S), hemagglutinin-esterase protein (HE), and nucleoprotein (N) genes from coronaviruses from adult cattle with winter dysentery, calves with neonatal diarrhea, and horses. To achieve this, eleven fecal samples from dairy cows with winter dysentery, three from calves, and two from horses, all from Brazil, were analysed. It could be concluded that the enteric BCoV genealogy from newborn and adult cattle is directly associated with geographic distribution patterns, when S and HE genes are taken into account. A less-resolved genealogy exists for the HE and N genes in cattle, with a trend for an age-related segregation pattern. The coronavirus strains from horses revealed Betacoronavirus sequences indistinguishable from those found in cattle, a fact previously unknown.",2013-11-17,"Barros, Iracema N.; Silva, Sheila O.

Material y métodos El período de estudio ha sido de 5 temporadas gripales, desde 1999-2000 hasta 2003-2004. Se revisaron los informes de recogida de datos correspondientes a las muestras obtenidas por 24 equipos de atención primaria distribuidos por el territorio de Cataluña, con resultados positivos para alguno de los virus estudiados (virus de la gripe A [VGA], virus de la gripe B [VGB], virus respiratorio sincitial [VRS] y adenovirus [ADV]). Se estudiaron las siguientes variables clínicas: inicio brusco, fiebre, sintomatología respiratoria, odinofagia, artromialgias, sintomatología gastrointestinal para cada tipo de virus en 2 grupos de edad: menores o iguales y mayores de 14 años. Como medidas de asociación se calcularon las odds ratio (OR) y sus intervalos de confianza (IC) del 95%. Resultados Del total de 1.591 muestras analizadas durante las 5 temporadas gripales estudiadas, un 42,68% (679) de las muestras obtenidas procedía de pacientes cuya edad era ≤ 14 años y el 57,32% (912) pertenecía a pacientes>14 años de edad. Se obtuvieron 286 positividades a VGA (166/286 [58,04%] en≤14 años, y 120/286 [41,95%] en>14 años), 107 muestras positivas a VGB (78/107 [72,90%] en≤14 años y 29/107 [27,10%] en>14 años), 53 a VRS (39/53 [73,58%] en≤14 años y 12/53 [22,64%] en>14 años) y 40 a ADV (36/40 [90%] en≤14 años y 4/40 [10%] en>14 años). Las diferencias de sintomatología entre ambos grupos de edad se pudieron comparar para el VGA, la fiebre (OR=16,536; IC del 95%, 4,893-55,887; p=0,001) y la sintomatología gastrointestinal (OR=4,664; IC del 95%, 1,569-13,868; p<0,036) resultaron ser significativamente más frecuentes en los ≤ 14 años que en los mayores de esa edad, mientras que las artromialgias (OR=0,048; IC del 95%, 0,026-0,089; p=0,001) lo fueron para los mayores de 14 años. Conclusiones Los datos obtenidos en este trabajo indican que entre las manifestaciones clínicas de las infecciones respiratorias agudas de etiología viral en la población pediátrica, a diferencia de lo que ocurre en la población adulta, la fiebre se encuentra asociada a todos los virus estudiados mientras que los síntomas gastrointestinales se asocian, en mayor grado, a las infecciones producidas por virus de la gripe A y B y que el grupo de edad de<5 años es el que muestra una mayor frecuencia de dichos síntomas. Abstract Objective To study differences in the presentation of laboratory-confirmed acute viral respiratory infections, especially gastroenteritis symptoms, according to age and causative viral agent during five influenza seasons (1999 to 2004.) Material and methods Five influenza seasons (1999-2000 to 2003-2004) were studied. Data from samples taken at 24 primary care sentinel centres for influenza surveillance distributed throughout Catalonia (Spain), which were positive for any of the viruses studied (influenza virus A, [IVA], influenza virus B [IVB], syncytial respiratory virus [SRV], adenovirus [ADV] and parainfluenza 1,2,3 viruses), were analyzed. The following clinical variables were evaluated: sudden onset, fever, respiratory symptoms, sore throat, malaise and gastrointestinal symptoms. These variables were studied for each virus and for two age groups: age 14 years or younger and older than 14 years. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results Of a total of 1,591 samples tested during the influenza seasons studied, 42.68% (679) samples belonged to subjects aged ≤ 14 years and 57.32% (912) to subjects aged>14 years. There were 286 IVA (166/286 [58.04%] in subjects aged ≤ 14 years and 120/286 [41.95%] in subjects aged>14 years), 107 were positive for IVB (78/107 [72.90%] in subjects aged ≤ 14 years and 29/107 [27.10%] in subjects aged>14 years), 53 SRV (39/53 [73.58%] in subjects aged ≤ 14 years and 12/53 [22.64%] in subjects aged>14 years) and 40 ADV (36/40 [90%] in subjects aged ≤ 14 years and 4/40 [10%] in subjects aged>14 years). The differences in symptoms between the two age groups could be compared for IVA: fever (OR=16.536; 95% CI=4.893-55.887; p=0.001) and gastrointestinal symptoms (OR=4.664; 95% CI=1.569-13.868; p<0.03) were significantly more frequent in subjects aged ≤ 14 years, while malaise (OR=0.048; 95% CI=0.026-0.089; p=0.001) was more frequent in subjects aged>14 years. Conclusions The results indicate that acute viral respiratory infections always present with fever in children, whatever the virus, but not in adults. Gastrointestinal symptoms were more strongly associated with IVA and IVB and these symptoms were most frequent in children aged under 5 years.",2005-01-31,"Torner, N.; Martínez, A.; Ruiz, L.; Pumarola, T.; Marcos, M.

Second, all suboptimal foldings up to a user-defined threshold can be enumerated. For large scale analysis, a fast sliding window mode is available. Further improvements of the Web Server are a new output visualization using the PseudoViewer Web Service or RNAmovies for a movie like animation of several suboptimal foldings.

Viral respiratory infections, such as rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus are likely to be important in the development and exacerbation of asthma. In this study, we investigated the nasopharyngeal colonization in children with asthma to determine the prevalence of pathogens and their contribution to respiratory symptoms and airway resistance during winter. METHODS: From December 2016 to March 2017, 50 nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from 18 patients (age, 5.0±1.1 years) with asthma and 9 specimens from 9 control children (age, 4.9±1.0 years). Samples were tested for 19 viruses and 7 bacteria, using multiplex real-time PCR. Respiratory disease markers included the Global Asthma Network Questionnaire, the Common-Cold Questionnaire, the Global Initiative for Asthma assessment of asthma control, and the airway resistance at 5 Hz by forced-oscillation technique. RESULTS: The most commonly isolated organisms in both groups (patients and controls) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and rhinovirus. Most patients had multiple isolates (median, 3.5; range, 1–5), which changed during the study period. Types of isolates were 4 bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Bordetella pertussis, and Bordetella parapertussis) and 6 viruses (rhinovirus, enterovirus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, coronaviruses, and parainfluenza viruses). Similar isolates, including influenza A-H3 virus and bocavirus, were detected in the controls. Of the 9 patients with “wheezing disturbing sleep ≥1 per week”, 6 had rhinovirus, 2 coronaviruses, and 1 no detectable viruses. Patients with mild common cold symptoms had significantly higher airway resistance at 5 Hz z-score (P=0.025). CONCLUSION: Multiple respiratory pathogens were isolated from many patients with asthma, which appeared to contribute to disease symptoms and airway resistance.

STUDY DESIGN: From March 2013 through March 2015 we enrolled 189 newborns (96 term and 93 pre-term) into a prospective, longitudinal study obtaining nose/throat swabs within 7 days of birth, weekly while hospitalized and then monthly to four months after hospital discharge. Taqman array cards (TAC) were used to identify 16 viral respiratory pathogens by real time PCR. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were gathered from electronic medical records and parent interview while hospitalized with interval histories collected at monthly visits. The hospital course of all pre-term infants who underwent late-onset sepsis evaluations was reviewed. RESULTS: Over 119 weeks, we collected 618 nose/throat swabs from at risk pre-term infants in our Level IV regional NICU. Only four infants had viral respiratory infections, all less than 28 weeks gestation at birth. Two infants were symptomatic with the infections recognized by the clinical team. The daily risk of acquiring a respiratory viral infection in pre-term infants in the NICU was significantly lower than in the full term cohort living in the community.

Such an approach relies upon an accurate diagnosis of an exacerbation, including judicious application of diagnostic tests. Determining the severity of an exacerbation follows this. If antibiotics are indicated, then a risk stratification approach is described to choose an appropriate antibiotic. An increase in airway inflammation from the baseline level in a patient appears central to the pathogenesis of most acute exacerbations. Airway inflammation measured in induced or expectorated sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchial biopsy has revealed that increased inflammation accompanies exacerbations and resolves with treatment. Potential pathogens in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations include typical respiratory bacterial pathogens, respiratory viruses, and atypical bacteria. The current model of bacterial exacerbation pathogenesis involves both host and pathogen factors. Acquisition of strains of bacterial pathogens that are new to the host from the environment is the primary event that puts the patient with COPD at risk for an exacerbation. The traditional aims of treatment of an exacerbation are improvement in clinical status and the prevention of complications. The role of antibiotics in the treatment of COPD exacerbations has been a matter of controversy. Even more contentious has been the issue whether antibiotic choice is relevant to clinical outcome of exacerbations. Recommendations for antibiotic use among published guidelines are inconsistent.",2009-12-31,"Sethi, Sanjay",Asthma and COPD,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3c9a6e7bab53eaf319bef1749c36ab5d182f205c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150331.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123740014000535; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123740014000535,68054580

El control antenatal debe mantenerse durante el periodo de crisis sanitaria, independientemente del estado de alerta COVID-19. La ecografía obstétrica en una prueba fundamental para la toma de decisiones clínicas durante el embarazo, con un impacto en el manejo del binomio madre-feto y en el resultado perinatal, por lo que se ha de garantizar su realización. Con el fin de reducir las visitas presenciales al mínimo número posible, estas se intentarán organizar teniendo en cuenta los controles ecográficos establecidos. Basados en la evidencia científica y en las principales guías nacionales e internacionales, hemos elaborado este documento que incluye las principales recomendaciones para el cuidado antenatal de la gestante en el contexto de la pandemia por SARS-CoV-2. En él se recoge cómo debe reestructurarse una Sección de Medicina Fetal ante esta nueva situación, qué medidas de seguridad deben seguirse para la realización de las exploraciones ecográficas y técnicas invasivas y de qué modo debe procederse para la limpieza y desinfección de los equipos ecográficos. Estas recomendaciones deberán adaptarse a los diferentes medios teniendo en cuenta la infraestructura del centro y sus recursos. Abstract During a pandemic, the three basic principles are; to prioritise medical resources, ensure patient lockdown in order to avoid community transmission and prevent healthcare collapse, and keep the number of visits to an absolute minimum to avoid patient exposure and safeguard healthcare workers. Antenatal care must be maintained during a health crisis, regardless of the COVID-19 state of alert. Routine and specialist obstetric ultrasound scans are essential for clinical decision-making during pregnancy, as it has a direct impact on the management of mothers and the foetuses and on the perinatal outcome. In an attempt to minimise in-person visits, these will be organised according to the established ultrasound schedule. Based on scientific evidence, and on existing main national and international guidelines, this document has been prepared, in which proposals and options are provided for managing pregnant women in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. It includes measured for how a Foetal Medicine Unit in this health crisis should be restructured, the safety measures that should be followed in the performance of obstetric scans and invasive procedures, and how the ultrasound rooms, equipment, and transducers, should be cleaned and disinfected.

Moreover, the clinical manifestation of ZIKV infection has apparently changed, as evident by increasing reports of neurological complications, such as Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults and congenital anomalies in neonates. We comprehensively compared the genome sequences of pre-epidemic and epidemic ZIKV strains with complete genome or complete polyprotein sequences available in GenBank. Besides the reported phylogenetic clustering of the epidemic strains with the Asian lineage, we found that the topology of phylogenetic tree of all coding regions is the same except that of the non-structural 2B (NS2B) coding region. This finding was confirmed by bootscan analysis and multiple sequence alignment, which suggested the presence of a fragment of genetic recombination at NS2B with that of Spondweni virus. Moreover, the representative epidemic strain possesses one large bulge of nine bases instead of an external loop on the first stem-loop structure at the 3′-untranslated region just distal to the stop codon of the NS5 in the 1947 pre-epidemic prototype strain. Fifteen amino acid substitutions are found in the epidemic strains when compared with the pre-epidemic strains. As mutations in other flaviviruses can be associated with changes in virulence, replication efficiency, antigenic epitopes and host tropism, further studies would be important to ascertain the biological significance of these genomic changes.",2016-03-16,"Zhu, Zheng; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Tee, Kah-Meng; Choi, Garnet Kwan-Yue; Lau, Susanna Kar-Pui; Woo, Patrick Chiu-Yat; Tse, Herman; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Emerg Microbes Infect,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d4f1ccfcf8b71a2828f39991e67142dd3a57fd1a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4820678.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26980239/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2016.48,997277

According to a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner Society, computed tomography (CT) is a relevant screening tool due to its higher sensitivity for detecting early pneumonic changes. However, physicians are extremely occupied fighting COVID-19 in this era of worldwide crisis. Thus, it is crucial to accelerate the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic tool to support physicians. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to rapidly develop an AI technique to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia in CT images and differentiate it from non–COVID-19 pneumonia and nonpneumonia diseases. METHODS: A simple 2D deep learning framework, named the fast-track COVID-19 classification network (FCONet), was developed to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia based on a single chest CT image. FCONet was developed by transfer learning using one of four state-of-the-art pretrained deep learning models (VGG16, ResNet-50, Inception-v3, or Xception) as a backbone. For training and testing of FCONet, we collected 3993 chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, other pneumonia, and nonpneumonia diseases from Wonkwang University Hospital, Chonnam National University Hospital, and the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology public database. These CT images were split into a training set and a testing set at a ratio of 8:2. For the testing data set, the diagnostic performance of the four pretrained FCONet models to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia was compared. In addition, we tested the FCONet models on an external testing data set extracted from embedded low-quality chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia in recently published papers. RESULTS: Among the four pretrained models of FCONet, ResNet-50 showed excellent diagnostic performance (sensitivity 99.58%, specificity 100.00%, and accuracy 99.87%) and outperformed the other three pretrained models in the testing data set. In the additional external testing data set using low-quality CT images, the detection accuracy of the ResNet-50 model was the highest (96.97%), followed by Xception, Inception-v3, and VGG16 (90.71%, 89.38%, and 87.12%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: FCONet, a simple 2D deep learning framework based on a single chest CT image, provides excellent diagnostic performance in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia. Based on our testing data set, the FCONet model based on ResNet-50 appears to be the best model, as it outperformed other FCONet models based on VGG16, Xception, and Inception-v3.",2020-06-29,"Ko, Hoon; Chung, Heewon; Kang, Wu Seong; Kim, Kyung Won; Shin, Youngbin; Kang, Seung Ji; Lee, Jae Hoon; Kim, Young Jun; Kim, Nan Yeol; Jung, Hyunseok; Lee, Jinseok",J Med Internet Res,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7332254.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.2196/19569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32568730/,219988561

The prevalence of RV species among HIV-infected children in South Africa is unknown. Objectives To describe the prevalence of respiratory viruses, including RV species, associated with HIV status and other clinical symptoms in children less than two years of age with and without ALRI in Pretoria, South Africa. Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 105 hospitalized ALRI cases and 53 non-ALRI controls less than two years of age. HIV status was determined. Common respiratory viruses were identified by PCR, and RV species and genotypes were identified by semi-nested PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic tree analyses. Results Respiratory viruses were more common among ALRI cases than controls (83.8% vs. 69.2%; p=0.041). RV was the most commonly identified virus in cases with pneumonia (45.6%) or bronchiolitis (52.1%), regardless of HIV status, as well as in controls (39.6%). RV-A was identified in 26.7% of cases and 15.1% of controls while RV-C was identified in 21.0% of cases and 18.9% of controls. HIV-infected children were more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia than bronchiolitis (p<0.01). RSV was not identified in any HIV-infected cases (n=15) compared with 30.6% of HIV-uninfected cases (n=85, p=0.013), and was identified more frequently in bronchiolitis than in pneumonia cases (43.8% vs. 12.3%; p<0.01).

This study addresses the question of whether clinical variability in PRRS results from (a) genetic variation among viral isolates and/or (b) variation in management practices among farms on which isolates are found. Genetic data (open reading frame 5 gene sequences) and data on farm characteristics and associated clinical disease signs were collected for 62 PRRS virus (PRRSV) field isolates, representing 52 farms. Clinical disease signs were interrelated — confirming that a true reproductive syndrome exists (involving abortions, infertility in sows, deaths of sows and preweaning mortality). Pairs of farms experiencing deaths in their sow populations also tended to share viral isolates which were more similar to one another than expected by chance alone. This implies that sow death (one of the more-severe manifestations of PRRS) is under genetic influence. Large herd size was a significant risk factor for the death of sows and for respiratory disease in nursery pigs. All-in–all-out management practices in the nursery were protective against reproductive signs in the sow herd. All-in–all-out management practices in the finishing stages of production were protective against respiratory disease in nursery pigs — but were paradoxically associated with an increased risk of infertility in sows. These results suggest that farm-management practices can also influence which PRRS clinical signs are manifested during an outbreak. In general, signs associated with PRRS appear to result from a combination of genetic factors and herd-management characteristics. The relative contributions of these two influences differ depending on the specific clinical sign in question.",2000-02-29,"Goldberg, Tony L.; Weigel, Ronald M.; Hahn, Edwin C.; Scherba, Gail",Preventive Veterinary Medicine,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7f78a49e121f4051e7752d2ddcd77be79d157630.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134204.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016758779900104X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10718497/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016758779900104X,14591469

El tratamiento disponible con fármacos antivirales, de ser administrado de forma precoz, puede reducir el riesgo de complicaciones severas; sin embargo, muchos tipos de virus desarrollan resistencia a estos fármacos, reduciendo notablemente su efectividad. Ha habido un gran interés en el desarrollo de nuevas opciones terapéuticas para combatir la enfermedad. Una gran variedad de fármacos han demostrado tener actividad antiinfluenza, pero aún no están disponibles para su uso en la clínica. Muchos de ellos tienen como objetivo componentes del virus, mientras que otros son dirigidos a elementos de la célula huésped que participan en el ciclo viral. Modular los componentes del huésped es una estrategia que minimiza el desarrollo de cepas resistentes, dado que estos no están sujetos a la variabilidad genética que tiene el virus. Por otro lado, la principal desventaja es que existe un mayor riesgo de efectos secundarios asociados al tratamiento. El objetivo de la presente revisión es describir los principales agentes farmacológicos disponibles en la actualidad, así como los nuevos fármacos en estudio con potencial beneficio en el tratamiento de la gripe. Abstract Influenza is a very common contagious disease that carries significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment with antiviral drugs is available, which if administered early, can reduce the risk of severe complications. However, many virus types develop resistance to those drugs, leading to a notable loss of efficacy. There has been great interest in the development of new drugs to combat this disease. A wide range of drugs has shown anti-influenza activity, but they are not yet available for use in the clinic. Many of these target viral components, which others are aimed at elements in the host cell which participate in the viral cycle. Modulating host components is a strategy which minimizes the development of resistance, since host components are not subject to the genetic variability of the virus. The main disadvantage is the risk of treatment-related side effects. The aim of this review is to describe the main pharmacological agents currently available and new drugs in the pipeline with potential benefit in the treatment of influenza.",2017-01-31,"Amarelle, Luciano; Lecuona, Emilia; Sznajder, Jacob I.",Archivos de Bronconeumología,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4e261c16f731485ca6c09dec03daa029787a69d4.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6889083.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300289616302058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27519544/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300289616302058; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2016.07.004,196473586

This study demonstrates that glial cells derived from neural progenitor cells are susceptible to JHMV infection and that treatment of infected cells with IFN-γ inhibits viral replication in a dose-dependent manner.

Also, direct treatment of infected glial cultures with recombinant mouse IFN-α or IFN-β inhibits viral replication. IFN-γ-mediated control of JHMV replication is dampened in glial cultures derived from the neural progenitor cells of type I receptor knock-out mice.

Focusing on IgG antibodies, we demonstrate the performance of two ELISA assays (Euroimmun SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG and Vircell COVID‐19 ELISA IgG) in comparison to one lateral flow assay ((LFA) FaStep COVID‐19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Device) and two in‐house developed assays (immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)). We tested follow up serum/plasma samples of individuals PCR‐diagnosed with COVID‐19. Most of the SARS‐CoV‐2 samples were from individuals with moderate to severe clinical course, who required an in‐patient hospital stay. For all examined assays, the sensitivity ranged from 58.8 to 76.5% for the early phase of infection (days 5‐9) and from 93.8 to 100% for the later period (days 10‐18). With exception of one sample, all positive tested COVID‐19 follow up‐samples, using the commercially available assays examined (including the in‐house developed IFA), demonstrated neutralizing properties in the PRNT.

However, the post-SARS period confirmed that this practice was not sustainable. At the Singapore General Hospital, a 1,600-bedded acute tertiary care hospital, the hand hygiene program was revised in early 2007 following Singapore's signing of the pledge to the World Health Organization (WHO) ""Clean Care is Safer Care"" program. FINDINGS: A multi-prong approach was used in designing the hand hygiene program. This included system change; training and education; evaluation and feedback; reminders in the workplace; and institutional safety climate. Hand hygiene compliance rate improved from 20% (in January 2007) to 61% (2010). Improvement was also seen annually in the compliance to each of the 5 moments as well as in all staff categories. Healthcare-associated MRSA infections were reduced from 0.6 (2007) to 0.3 (2010) per 1000 patient-days. CONCLUSIONS: Leadership's support of the program evidenced through visible leadership presence, messaging and release of resources is the key factor in helping to make the program a true success.

However, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 and much remains unknown about this disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 is a cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2. It is cleaved by type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS)2 and disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain (ADAM)17 to assist viral entry into host cells. Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in acute lung injury and lung fibrosis, but the underlying mechanisms of COVID-19 induced lung fibrosis are not fully understood. METHODS: The networks of ACE2 and its interacting molecules were identified using bioinformatic methods. Their gene and protein expressions were measured in human epithelial cells after 24 h SARS-CoV-2 infection, or in existing datasets of lung fibrosis patients. RESULTS: We confirmed the binding of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 by bioinformatic analysis. TMPRSS2, ADAM17, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)3, angiotensinogen (AGT), transformation growth factor beta (TGFB1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A and fibronectin (FN) were interacted with ACE2, and the mRNA and protein of these molecules were expressed in lung epithelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection increased ACE2, TGFB1, CTGF and FN1 mRNA that were drivers of lung fibrosis. These changes were also found in lung tissues from lung fibrosis patients.

Of the thus-far identified gD receptors, nectin-1 is likely the most effective in terms of its wide usage by multiple alphaherpesviruses for cell entry. The molecular basis of nectin-1 recognition by the gD protein is therefore an interesting scientific question in the alphaherpesvirus field. Previous studies focused on the herpes simplex virus (HSV) of the Simplexvirus genus, for which both the free gD structure and the gD/nectin-1 complex structure were reported at high resolutions. The structural and functional features of other alphaherpesviral gDs, however, remain poorly characterized. In the current study, we systematically studied the characteristics of nectin-1 binding by the gD of a Varicellovirus genus member, the pseudorabies virus (PRV). We first showed that PRV infects host cells via both human and swine nectin-1, and that its gD exhibits similar binding affinities for nectin-1 of the two species. Furthermore, we demonstrated that removal of the PRV gD membrane-proximal residues could significantly increase its affinity for the receptor binding. The structures of PRV gD in the free and the nectin-1-bound states were then solved, revealing a similar overall 3D fold as well as a homologous nectin-1 binding mode to its HSV counterpart. However, several unique features were observed at the binding interface of PRV gD, enabling the viral ligand to utilize different gD residues (from those of HSV) for nectin-1 engagement. These observed binding characteristics were further verified by the mutagenesis study using the key-residue mutants of nectin-1. The structural and functional data obtained in this study, therefore, provide the basis of receptor recognition by PRV gD.",2017-05-19,"Li, An; Lu, Guangwen; Qi, Jianxun; Wu, Lili; Tian, Kegong; Luo, Tingrong; Shi, Yi; Yan, Jinghua; Gao, George F.",PLoS Pathog,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/09525027db30dc3a6945da255f80b2099e239c48.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5453625.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28542478/,6423571

Here, we identify a viral protease as a target of NO. The life cycle of many viruses depends upon viral proteases that cleave viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides. NO inactivates the Coxsackievirus protease 3C, an enzyme necessary for the replication of Coxsackievirus. NO S-nitrosylates the cysteine residue in the active site of protease 3C, inhibiting protease activity and interrupting the viral life cycle. Substituting a serine residue for the active site cysteine renders protease 3C resistant to NO inhibition. Since cysteine proteases are critical for virulence or replication of many viruses, bacteria, and parasites, S-nitrosylation of pathogen cysteine proteases may be a general mechanism of antimicrobial host defenses.",1999-01-01,"Saura, Marta; Zaragoza, Carlos; McMillan, Audrey; Quick, Richard A; Hohenadl, Christine; Lowenstein, John M; Lowenstein, Charles J",Immunity,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e2cd9385b6fe84f42f1f6d0c99053c3ec6e2bcdb.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129050.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761300800035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761300800035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10023767/,5836238

METHODS: Osteoblasts were isolated from rabbit bones and treated with 1 μM Methylprednisolone for 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. The Beclin1, MAP1LC3, Atg‐5, Atg‐12, IFT20 and OFD1 mRNAs and proteins were detected by PCR and Western blotting, and their correlation was statistically analyzed. The lengths of osteoblast cilia were measured under a laser confocal microscope, and the autophagy flux was tracked by transfecting the osteoblasts with GFP‐RFP‐LC3 lentivirus. RESULTS: Methylprednisolone significantly upregulated Beclin1, MAP1LC3, Atg‐5, Atg‐12 and OFD1 mRNAs and proteins in a time‐dependent manner, and decreased that of IFT20 (P < 0.05). In addition, the autophagy flux in the osteoblasts also increased and the ciliary length decreased in a time‐dependent manner after Methylprednisolone treatment. The length of the cilia were 5.46 ± 0.11 um at 0 h, 4.08 ± 0.09 um at 12 h, 3.07 ± 0.07 um at 24 h, 2.31 ± 0.10 um at 48 h, and finally 1.15 ± 0.04 um at 72 h. Methylprednisolone treatment also affects primary cilium numbers in cultures, for 0 to 72 h. The autophagy regulatory genes, Beclin1, MAP1LC3, Atg‐5 and Atg‐12, were found to be negatively correlated with IFT20, with an average correlation coefficient of −0.81. A negative correlation was also found between OFD1 and IFT20, with an average correlation coefficient of −0.53. CONCLUSION: Methylprednisolone inhibits primary cilia formation and promotes autophagy, which could be the pathological basis of SANFH.

With the recent emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2, the availability of rapid, sensitive, and reliable diagnostic methods is essential for disease control. Hence, we have developed a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the specific detection of SARS-CoV-2. The primer sets for RT-LAMP assay were designed to target the nucleocapsid gene of the viral RNA, and displayed a detection limit of 10(2) RNA copies close to that of qRT-PCR. Notably, the assay has exhibited a rapid detection span of 30 min combined with the colorimetric visualization. This test can detect specifically viral RNAs of the SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity to related coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and MERS-CoV as well as human infectious influenza viruses (type B, H1N1pdm, H3N2, H5N1, H5N6, H5N8, and H7N9), and other respiratory disease-causing viruses (RSVA, RSVB, ADV, PIV, MPV, and HRV). Furthermore, the developed RT-LAMP assay has been evaluated using specimens collected from COVID-19 patients that exhibited high agreement to the qRT-PCR. Our RT-LAMP assay is simple to perform, less expensive, time-efficient, and can be used in clinical laboratories for preliminary detection of SARS-CoV-2 in suspected patients.

Ultrasound, although not used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 may be utilised by practitioners at the point of care (POC) or on the intensive care units (ITUs) where rapid assessment of the lung condition may be required. The aim of this article was to review current literature surrounding the use of lung ultrasound in relation to COVID-19 and provide Sonographers with a quick and digestible reference guide for lung pathologies. Key findings Ultrasound is being used in Italy and China to help review lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak however not strictly as a diagnostic tool as Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest and chest radiographs are currently gold standard. Ultrasound is highly sensitive in the detection of multiple lung pathologies which can be demonstrated in conjunction with COVID-19 however to date there are no specific, nor pathognomonic findings which relate to COVID-19 on ultrasound. Conclusion Lung ultrasound is highly sensitive and can quickly and accurately review lung condition creating potential to assess for changes or resolution over time, especially in the ITU and POC setting. However it should not be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 due to low specificity in relation to the virus. Implications for practice The adoption of lung ultrasound to monitor lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak may reduce the need for serial exposure to ionising radiation on the wards and in turn reduce the number of radiographers required to attend infected wards and bays, protecting both patients and the workforce.",2020-04-17,"Moore, S.; Gardiner, E.",Radiography (Lond),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ea210d6645ebbd59703dce661d49a466abc3b322.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164867.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078817420300572; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2020.04.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078817420300572; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32327383/,215801127

Methods: In 2 consecutive clinical studies, calves were initially treated with saline (5.85%; 5 mL/kg body weight [BW] over 4 minutes; study I: N = 16) or bicarbonate solution (8.4%; 10 mL/kg BW over 8 minutes; study II: N = 12), respectively, followed by oral administration of 3 L isotonic electrolyte solution 5 minutes after injection. Clinical and laboratory variables were monitored for 72 hours. Results: Treatment failed in 6 calves of study I and in 1 calf of study II as indicated by a deterioration of the general condition. All treatment failures had more severe metabolic acidosis compared with successfully treated calves before treatment. In the latter, rehydration was completed within 18 hours after injection; metabolic acidosis was corrected within 24 hours (study I) and 6 hours (study II) after injection. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Diarrheic calves with slight metabolic acidosis (base excess [BE] >−10 mM) can be treated successfully with hypertonic saline. HBS is appropriate in calves without respiratory problems with more severe metabolic acidosis (BE up to −20 mM). Intensive care of the calves is required to ensure a sufficient oral fluid intake after the initial IV treatment.",2008-02-14,"Koch, A.; Kaske, M.",J Vet Intern Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7c2a10120e33a16754606e8b8277b14cccc3aa6f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166734.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1939-1676.2007.0029.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18289311/,25405392

In this first population-based study, a web-based survey was conducted during the peak of the outbreak to assess stress and its correlates in the Iranian population. A 54-item, valid, and reliable questionnaire, including items on demographic characteristics and past medical history, stress levels, awareness about signs and symptoms of COVID-19, knowledge about at-risk groups and prevention methods, knowledge about transmission methods, trust in sources of information, and availability of facemasks and sanitizers, was deployed via social and mass media networks. A total of 3787 Iranians participated in the study where the majority of the participants were females (67.4%), employed (56.1%), from developed provinces (81.6%), without chronic diseases (66.6%), and with ≥13 years of formal education (87.9%). The mean age of study participants was 34.9 years (range = 12–73), and the average stress score was 3.33 (SD = ±1.02). Stress score was significantly higher for females, those who were 30–39 years old, housewives, those with chronic diseases, individuals who were aware that there is no vaccine to prevent COVID-19, those who could not get facemasks or sanitizers, and individuals with higher knowledge about at-risk groups (p < 0.05). There was a significant correlation of stress scores with knowledge about prevention methods for COVID-19 (r = 0.21, p = 0.01) and trust in sources of information about COVID-19 (r = −0.18, p = 0.01). All of the predictors, except knowledge of two important at-risk groups and education, had a significant effect on stress scores based on a multivariate regression model. The COVID-19 outbreak could increase stress among all population groups, with certain groups at higher risk. In the high-risk groups and based on experience with previous pandemics, interventions are needed to prevent long-term psychological effects.

SLAM suppression was assessed using real-time PCR and flow cytometry to confirm suppression at the m-RNA and protein levels, respectively. Three chemically synthesized siRNAs were transfected individually using oligofectamine into B95a cell line. This resulted in SLAM suppression from 48 to 454-folds, in comparison to the untransfected B95a cell line. When the SLAM suppressed B95a cell line was infected with PPRV, replication was reduced by 12–143-folds and virus titre was reduced from log10 1.09 to 2.28. siRNA 3 showed the most potent inhibition of SLAM expression both at m-RNA and protein levels. This also caused the maximum reduction of virus replication and virus titre. A 100-fold reduction in PPRV titres was seen in anti-SLAM antibody neutralized B95a cell line.

PEDV obtained after ten passages through the brains (MK-p10) had increased virulence for mice, and its fusion activity in cultured cells exceeded that of the original strain. However, the replication kinetics of MK and MK-p10 did not differ from each other in the brain and in cultured cells.

This collaboration should be within the framework of the International Health Regulations. Collaboration between countries should be encouraged in a way that acknowledges the benefits that derive from sharing biological material and establishing equitable collaborative research partnerships. The focus of pandemic preparedness should include upstream prevention through better collaboration between human and animal health sciences to enhance capacity to identify potential pathogens before they become serious human threats, and to prevent their emergence where possible.

Four antigenic sites (A, B, C and D) were defined by competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) selected from 9 fusions. About 20% (197) of the hybridomas specific for TGE virus produced neutralizing MAbs specific for site A, which was one of the antigenically dominant determinants. Site A was differentiated in three antigenic subsites: a, b and c, by characterization of 11 MAb resistant (mar) mutants, that were defined by 8, 3, and 3 MAbs, respectively. These subsites were further subdivided in epitopes. A total of 11 epitopes were defined in E2 glycoprotein, eight of which were critical for virus neutralization. Neutralizing MAbs were obtained only when native virus was used to immunize mice, although to produce hybridomas mice immunizations were made with antigen in the native, denatured, or mixtures of native and denatured form. All neutralizing MAbs reacted to conformational epitopes. The antigenic structure of the E2-glycoprotein has been defined with murine MAbs, but the antigenic sites were relevant in the swine, the natural host of the virus, because porcine sera reacted against these sites. MAbs specific for TGE virus site C reacted to non-immune porcine sera. This reactivity was not directed against porcine immunoglobulins. These results indicated that TGE virus contains epitope(s) also present in some non-immunoglobulin component of porcine serum.",1988-04-30,"Correa, Isabel; Jiménez, Gustavo; Suñé, Carlos; Bullido, María J.; Enjuanes, Luis",Virus Research,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/45ca49b78fd033c5e37ec5482918b446f5841c93.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2453977/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168170288900597; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170288900597,22653057

NK cells can induce the death of autologous cells undergoing various forms of stress, recognizing and providing non‐microbial ‘danger’ signals to the immune system. NK cells are widely distributed in lymphoid and non‐lymphoid organs. NK cell precursors originate from the bone marrow and go through a complex maturation process that leads to the acquisition of their effector functions, to changes in their expression of integrins and chemotactic receptors, and to their redistribution from the bone marrow and lymph nodes to blood, spleen, liver, and lung.

The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has progressively expanded from China, involving several countries throughout the world, leading to the classification of the disease as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to published reports, COVID-19 severity and mortality are higher in elderly patients and those with active comorbidities. In particular, lung cancer patients were reported to be at high risk of pulmonary complications related to SARS-CoV2 infection. Therefore, the management of cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic is a crucial issue, to which national and international oncology organizations have replied with recommendations concerning patients receiving anticancer treatments, delaying follow-up visits and limiting caregiver admission to the hospitals. In this historical moment, medical oncologists are required to consider the possibility to delay active treatment administration based on a case-by-case risk/benefit evaluation. Potential risks associated with COVID-19 infection should be considered, considering tumor histology and natural course, disease setting, clinical conditions, and disease burden, together with the expected benefit, toxicities (e.g., myelosuppression or interstitial lung disease), and response obtained from the planned or ongoing treatment. In this study, we report the results of proactive measures including social media, telemedicine, and telephone triage for screening patients with lung cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak in the European Institute of Oncology (Milan, Italy). Proactive management and containment measures, applied in a structured and daily way, has significantly aided the identification of advance patients with suspected symptoms related to COVID-19, limiting their admission to our cancer center; we have thus been more able to protect other patients from possible contamination and at the same time guarantee to the suspected patients the immediate treatment and evaluation in referral hospitals for COVID-19.",2020-04-22,"de Marinis, Filippo; Attili, Ilaria; Morganti, Stefania; Stati, Valeria; Spitaleri, Gianluca; Gianoncelli, Letizia; Del Signore, Ester; Catania, Chiara; Rampinelli, Cristiano; Omodeo Salè, Emanuela; Spaggiari, Lorenzo; Mastrilli, Fabrizio; Passaro, Antonio",Front Oncol,,#242245,,document_parses/pdf_json/1148e02bb3dd950414027661da6770f4cd93c09c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188943.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.00665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32391282/,216044465

STUDY DESIGN: Evaluation study. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of staff who worked in the West Midlands FRC between 18 May 2009 and 10 July 2009 using an online self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included sections related to the respondents' FRC experience, knowledge about influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and the containment phase. RESULTS: This study had a 51% (89/176) response rate. Of the respondents, 59% were female, 64% were of White ethnicity, 55% were clinicians, 46% were aged 25–44 years, and 67% had no previous call centre experience. A significant proportion (P < 0.001) of respondents believed that the FRC had made a positive contribution to the public health management of the containment phase. Nearly all respondents indicated that they were familiar with the terms ‘pandemic flu’ or ‘influenza pandemic’ (99%), understood the aim of the containment phase (90%), and knew the severity of the illness caused by the virus (97%). However, specific knowledge was lacking regarding a number of public health interventions, and overall knowledge scores for clinicians and non-clinicians were similar.

However, limited data exist on military populations in tropical settings, where the epidemiology of respiratory infections differs substantially from temperate settings. We enrolled recruits undertaking a 10-week military training at two Royal Thai Army barracks between May 2014 and July 2015. We used a multiplex respiratory panel to analyze nose and throat swabs collected at the start and end of the training period, and from participants experiencing respiratory symptoms during follow-up.

For these methods to be successful, a potential cause of infection must be suspected. More recently, multiplex PCR and multiplex RT-PCR were used to enable more broad-range testing based on panels of suspected pathogens. PCR–electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR-ESI/MS) has emerged as a technology that is capable of identifying nearly all known human pathogens either from microbial isolates or directly from clinical specimens. Assay primers are strategically designed to target one or more of the broad pathogen categories: bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, or viral. With broad-range amplification followed by detection of mixed amplicons, the method can identify genetic evidence of known and unknown pathogens. This unique approach supports a higher form of inquiry, asking the following question: What is the genetic evidence of known or unknown pathogens in the patient sample? This approach has advantages over traditional assays that commonly target the presence or absence of one or more pathogens with known genetic composition.

Study design A retrospective review to evaluate the use of a negative-pressure otolaryngology viral isolation drape (NOVID) system to reduce cross-infection through aerosol. The apparatus consists of a plastic drape suspended over the surgical field in the head and neck region with a smoke evacuator suction placed inside the chamber with an ultra-low penetrating air (ULPA) efficiency rating and a fluid suction high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter compartment. Spread of patient secretions and droplet formation was evaluated using 1% fluorescein dye in 10 ml of normal saline and ultraviolet light. The dye was applied topically in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx preoperatively and intraoperatively prior to the use of instruments such as micro-debrider, electrocautery and high-speed drilling. Following completion of the surgical procedure, an ultraviolet Wood's lamp was used to evaluate the presence of droplets on the surgical drapes and surgical gowns of the operating team. Results The study sample consisted of four patients who underwent endonasal endoscopic surgical procedures; two of these patients required concurrent endoscopic sinus surgery. A micro-debrider was used in three cases; electrocautery in three cases, while a high-speed drilling was employed in two cases. Presence of fluorescein was identified around the patients' nares; on the chest wipe and instrument tray in all four patients. Dye contamination was noted on the gauze placed over the smoke evacuator (two cases of skull base surgery); no fluid droplets were identified beyond the nares or the smoke evacuator (two cases of sinus surgery). However, fluid contamination was identified underneath barrier several centimetres away from the nares (one case of trans-sphenoidal surgery). Droplets were also identified on the surgeon's gown in the abdominal region in all cases and on the arm region in one case. In one case, droplets were also identified on the abdominal region of the nurse, but this was attributed to cross contamination from surgical gauze and instruments. Conclusions This retrospective study provides preliminary data on aerosol and droplet contamination during endonasal and transoral surgery performed under a negative pressure isolation drape system. Although the authors did not screen patients for SARS-CoV-2, they propose smoke evacuator ULPA filter attachment is appropriate to capture particles down to 0.1 microns including SARS-CoV-2 which is 0.125 microns. It would be helpful to see direct evidence to support this claim in future studies. The authors have not provided details regarding set-up time and training requirements for effective application of the isolation drape apparatus or the associated costs etc. It would have also been helpful if the authors could comment on any potential difficulties in undertaking the surgical procedure with the isolation system in place. The sample size is limited to four patients and variations in the magnitude and extent of aerosol contamination needs to be investigated further before drawing any conclusions. Although unlikely, this study design did not capture the presence of aerosol/droplets in the air within the operating room which may follow removal of the isolation drape system or from exposed surgical instruments. Notwithstanding the limitations of the design, negative-pressure aspiration of air under a chamber barrier is likely to minimise the contamination from aerosol and droplet during endonasal and transoral surgery.",2020-06-26,"Ali, Kamran; Raja, Mahwish",Evid Based Dent,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/975af92e44ddcc66843cd8154b7277f709817003.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7317264.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41432-020-0088-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32591652/,220064678

The influence of possible stressors on their mental health were investigated, including inadequate supplies and fears of infection. Five hundred and fifty-five undergraduate students were recruited from Hebei Agricultural University in Baoding, China. The participants completed two online surveys—on anxiety and depression, and on positive and negative affect. One survey was conducted before the confinement and the other was conducted 15–17 days after the start of the confinement. Increases in negative affect and symptoms of anxiety and depression (p-values < 0.001) were observed after 2 weeks of confinement. Inadequate supplies of hand sanitizers, a higher year of study, and higher scores on anxiety and depression were common predictors of increased negative affect, anxiety, and depression across the confinement period.

The intermodal containerized movement of grains and food products has seen some disruption from the lack of empty containers in North America. The widespread consumer adoption of physical distancing measures has vastly increased the demand for retail food pickup and delivery services to the point where these services are being rationed by long wait times.

Overall, 19 (2.9%) out of 645 diarrheic samples from 19 herds (6.9%) tested positive for BToVs by either RT-PCR or nested PCR. A comparison of the nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) sequences of a part of the BToV M gene (409bp) among the BToVs showed the Korean BToVs to have comparatively higher sequence homology to the Japanese and Dutch BToVs than to the American and Italian BToVs. Generally, the Korean BToV strains clustered with the Japanese and Dutch BToV strains. However, the American and Italian BToV strains clustered on a separate major branch, suggesting that these are more distantly related to other known BToV strains.

Toutefois, le risque d’infection lors de l’hospitalisation et ses conséquences sont encore très peu connus. Le but de ce travail était de rapporter une série de patients hospitalisés en chirurgie digestive chez qui une infection nosocomiale à SARS-Cov-2 a été diagnostiquée. Méthodes: Etude rétrospective non-interventionnelle réalisée au sein de 3 services de chirurgie digestive. Les données cliniques, biologiques et radiologiques des patients ayant développé une infection nosocomiale au SARS-Cov-2 ont été collectées à partir des dossiers informatisés. Résultats: Du 1er Mars 2020 au 5 Avril 2020, parmi 305 patients admis en chirurgie digestive, 15 (4.9%) ont présenté une infection nosocomiale à SARS-Cov-2. Il s’agissait de 9 hommes et 6 femmes, d’un âge médian de 62 ans (35-68 ans). Tous les patients présentaient une comorbidité. Les motifs d’hospitalisation étaient : traitement chirurgical d’un cancer (n=5), urgences complexes (n=5), traitement de complications liées au cancer ou à son traitement (n=3), reconstruction par gastroplastie (n=1), fermeture de stomie (n=1). Le délai médian entre l’admission et le diagnostic d’infection à SARS-Cov-2 était de 34 jours (5-61 jours). Chez 12 (80%) patients, le diagnostic a été posé après une durée d’hospitalisation de plus de 14 jours (15-63 jours). A l’issue du suivi, 2 patients sont décédés, 7 étaient hospitalisés dont 2 sous assistance respiratoire et 6 patients étaient sortis d’hospitalisation. Conclusions: Le risque d’infection au SARS-Cov-2 au cours d’une hospitalisation ou dans les suites d’une intervention de chirurgie digestive est un risque réel et potentiellement grave. Des mesures sont nécessaires afin de minimiser ce risque dans la perspective d’une reprise de l’activité chirurgicale en toute sécurité. SUMMARY Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic imposed a drastic reduction in surgical activity in order to respond to the influx of hospital patients and to protect uninfected patients by avoiding hospitalization. However, little is known about the risk of infection during hospitalization or its consequences. The aim of this work was to report a series of patients hospitalized on digestive surgery services who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 virus. Methods: This is a non-interventional retrospective study carried out within three departments of digestive surgery. The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 were collected from the computerized medical record. Results: From March 1, 2020 to April 5, 2020, among 305 patients admitted to digestive surgery services, 15 (4.9%) developed evident nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2. There were nine men and six women, with a median age of 62 years (35-68 years). All patients had co-morbidities. The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n = 5), complex emergencies (n = 5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n = 3), gastroplasty (n = 1), and stoma closure (n = 1). The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection was 34 days (5-61 days). In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15-63 days). At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization. Conclusions: The risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk. Measures are necessary to minimize this risk in order to return to safe surgical activity.",2020-04-24,"Luong-Nguyen, Minh; Hermand, Hélène; Abdalla, Solafah; Cabrit, Nicolas; Hobeika, Christian; Brouquet, Antoine; Goéré, Diane; Sauvanet, Alain",Journal de chirurgie viscerale,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/bd6d0134533e6f16c1af6e275fa99fba40179861.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32341721/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878786X20301005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878786X20301005?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.04.012,216106541

Currently, there is no proven effective therapy against the virus, and the impact on other diseases is also uncertain, especially inherited arrhythmia syndrome. Arrhythmogenic effect of COVID-19 can be expected, potentially contributing to disease outcome. This may be of importance for patients with an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias, either secondary to acquired conditions or co-morbidities or consequent to inherited syndromes. Management of patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes such as Long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, Short QT syndrome and Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic may prove particularly challenging.

However, some NDV strains, such as Beaudette C (BC), may retain too much virulence in poultry for safe use, and more highly attenuated strains may be suboptimally immunogenic. We therefore modified the BC strain by changing the multibasic cleavage site sequence of the F protein to the dibasic sequence of avirulent strain LaSota. Additionally, the BC, F, and HN proteins were modified in several ways to enhance virus replication. These modified BC-derived vectors and the LaSota strain were engineered to express the hemagglutin (HA) protein of H5N1 highly pathogenic influenza virus (HPAIV). In general, the modified BC-based vectors expressing HA replicated better than LaSota/HA, and expressed higher levels of HA protein. Pathogenicity tests indicated that all the modified viruses were highly attenuated in chickens. Based on in vitro characterization, two of the modified BC vectors were chosen for evaluation in chickens as vaccine vectors against H5N1 HPAIV A/Vietnam/1203/04. Immunization of chickens with rNDV vector vaccines followed by challenge with HPAIV demonstrated high levels of protection against clinical disease and mortality.

Methods In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with CPB, cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and blood pressure (BP) were continuously recorded during 5-min preoperatively (T1), after 24 h (T2), and 7 days after procedure (T3). Prospective multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the independent risk factors of PD. Autoregulation index (ARI) was calculated from the CBFV response to a step change in BP derived by transfer function analysis. Results In 67 patients, mean age 64.3 ± 9.5 years, CA was depressed at T2 as shown by values of ARI (3.9 ± 1.7), compared to T1 (5.6 ± 1.7) and T3 (5.5 ± 1.8) (p < 0.001). Impaired CA was found in 37 (55%) patients at T2 and in 7 patients (20%) at T3. Lower ARI at T1 and T2 were predictors of PD (p = 0.003). Conclusion Dynamic CA was impaired after CABG surgery with CPB and was a significant independent risk factor of PD. Significance Assessment of CA before and after surgery could have considerable potential for early identification of patients at risk of PD, thus reducing poor outcomes and length of stay.

TRAF3 negatively regulates the activation of the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways and is one of the key proteins in antiviral immunity. Scope of Review: Here we provide a structural overview of TRAF3 signaling in terms of its competitive binding and consequences to the cellular network. For completion, we also include molecular mimicry of TRAF3 physiological partners by some viral proteins. Major Conclusions: By out-competing host partners, viral proteins aim to subvert TRAF3 antiviral action. Mechanistically, dynamic, competitive binding by the organism's own proteins and same-site adaptive pathogen mimicry follow the same conformational selection principles. General Significance: Our premise is that irrespective of the eliciting event – physiological or acquired pathogenic trait – pathway activation (or suppression) may embrace similar conformational principles. However, even though here we largely focus on competitive binding at a shared site, similar to physiological signaling other pathogen subversion mechanisms can also be at play.

However, since shifts in infection susceptibility after commensal bacteria eradication have primarily been probed using viruses, the broader applicability to other pathogen types remains undefined. In sharp contrast to diminished antiviral immunity, we show commensal bacteria eradication bolsters protection against disseminated Candida albicans fungal infection. Enhanced antifungal immunity reflects more robust systemic expansion of Ly6G(hi)Ly6C(int) neutrophils, and their mobilization into infected tissues among antibiotic treated compared with commensal bacteria replete control mice. Reciprocally, depletion of neutrophils from expanded levels or intestinal LPS reconstitution overrides the antifungal protective benefits conferred by commensal bacteria eradication. This discordance in antifungal compared with antiviral immunity highlights intrinsic differences in how commensal bacteria control responsiveness for specific immune cell subsets because pathogen-specific CD8(+) T cells that protect against viruses were suppressed similarly after C. albicans and influenza A virus infection. Thus, positive calibration of antiviral immunity by commensal bacteria is counterbalanced by restrained activation of other immune components that confer antifungal immunity.",2014-12-10,"Jiang, Tony T.; Chaturvedi, Vandana; Ertelt, James M.; Xin, Lijun; Clark, Dayna R.; Kinder, Jeremy M.; Way, Sing Sing",Mucosal Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/433adf76ea9adc9f5c540d4c28142d4d020969e2.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4465067.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1038/mi.2014.119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25492473/,7916506

Due to their unique working conditions, nursing is counted among the occupational groups at high risk for developing depression. Because of the shortage of nursing resources in China, Chinese nurses suffer from heavy daily workloads more than those in many other countries. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the overall prevalence of depressive symptoms and analyse the potential risk factors of depressive symptoms in Chinese nurses. METHODS: A systematic literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Weipu and Wanfang databases up to Dec 31st, 2019 was performed regarding the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Chinese nurses. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were performed independently by 2 researchers, and meta-analysis was used to synthesize the data. Heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochran’s Q test and quantified using the I(2) statistic. To explore the potential source of heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were also performed. In addition, both funnel plot and Egger’s tests were adopted to assess publication bias. RESULTS: A total of 102 studies published from 1996 to 2019 covering 22 provinces were included for further analysis. The total number of participants was 52,592, with a range of 46 to 7205 per study. The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms in Chinese nurses was 43.83% (95%CI: 40.26%-47.42%), and 31.12% (95%CI: 27.30%-35.07%) were classified as mild degrees of depressive symptoms. The prevalence of depressive symptoms may be significantly affected by region, province or municipality and department marital status. Moreover, an increasing trend in the prevalence of depressive symptoms was observed in recent years. CONCLUSION: The results presented a high prevalence of depressive symptoms among Chinese nurses, which suggests interventional programmes by health decision-makers to improving the mental state of nurses is needed urgently, especially in nurses with high risk factors for depressive symptoms.

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for reducing the risk of severe complications and death. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the case diagnosis situation among medical care institutions and geographical regions in China, and the results will benefit both clinical practice and the disease surveillance system. METHODS: We extracted individual scrub typhus case data 2006–2016 from a national disease surveillance system in China. The diagnosis category and interval time from illness onset to diagnosis were compared among three levels of medical care institutions and provinces. The descriptive analysis method was performed in our study. RESULTS: During the 11-year study period, 93 481 scrub typhus cases, including 57 deaths, were recorded in the nationwide surveillance system. The overall proportion of laboratory-confirmed cases was only 4.7%, and this proportion varied greatly among primary medical centres (2.8%), county level hospitals (4.2%), and city level hospitals (6.3%). Notably, the proportion of laboratory-confirmed cases has consistently decreased from 16.3% in 2006 to 2.6% in 2016, and the same decreasing trend was found among all three levels of medical care institutions. The interval from illness onset to case diagnosis (T(diag)) for all cases was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 2–9 days) and decreased from 7 days (IQR: 3–11 days) in 2006 to 5 days (IQR: 2–8 days) in 2016. The risk of death for patients with a T(diag) of > 7 days was 2.2 times higher (OR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.05–5.21) than that of patients with a T(diag) of < 2 days. CONCLUSIONS: The interval time from illness onset to diagnosis for scrub typhus cases decreased greatly in China; however, the diagnosis rate of cases with laboratory-confirmed results must be increased among all levels of medical care institutions to reduce both the risk of death and the misuse of antibiotics associated with scrub typhus.

Decreased involvement of neurons in the brains of protected mice was observed, and no evidence of neuronal infection in the spinal cords was found. In contrast, oligodendrocytes were infected in the presence of protective antibody, and evidence of demylination associated with mononuclear cell infiltration was found. These studies demonstrate that antibody to a single epitope on a viral glycoprotein can substantially alter the course and phenotype of disease.",1984-01-30,"Buchmeier, Michael J.; Lewicki, Hanna A.; Talbot, Pierre J.; Knobler, Robert L.",Virology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/db9141472d70bd95d435fa5dd2245682d627e051.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6199889/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682284900333; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682284900333,43655459

They can be activated by a repertoire of endogenous and exogenous stimuli, leading to enzymatic activation of canonical caspase-1, noncanonical caspase-11 (or the equivalent caspase-4 and caspase-5 in humans) or caspase-8, resulting in secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, as well as apoptotic and pyroptotic cell death. Appropriate inflammasome activation is vital for the host to cope with foreign pathogens or tissue damage, while aberrant inflammasome activation can cause uncontrolled tissue responses that may contribute to various diseases, including autoinflammatory disorders, cardiometabolic diseases, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain a fine balance between inflammasome activation and inhibition, which requires a fine-tuned regulation of inflammasome assembly and effector function. Recently, a growing body of studies have been focusing on delineating the structural and molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of inflammasome signaling. In the present review, we summarize the most recent advances and remaining challenges in understanding the ordered inflammasome assembly and activation upon sensing of diverse stimuli, as well as the tight regulations of these processes.

Over the past years, hand hygiene guidelines have been developed by different agencies at international, national and subnational levels. A comparison of these documents could help in understanding recommendations in different parts of the world and the methods used for their development. Guidelines were identified through search engines, electronic libraries, and personal contacts, and their content was analysed using an adapted version of a tool from the European DG XII-funded HARMONY project. Twenty-two guidelines were retrieved and 21 were evaluated. Documents varied in scope, approach, content and terminology. Some were primarily advisory directives, whereas others focused on the technical issues of why, when, and how to perform hand hygiene. The extent to which evidence was collected and assessed varied considerably and details were provided only in very few. Grading systems and definitions to indicate the strength of evidence and recommendations also differed. The intended outcome was to improve hand hygiene practices in healthcare, thus leading to a reduction of healthcare-associated infections and/or antimicrobial resistance. Although overall agreement on indications and procedures was noted, the range and depth of recommendations on best practices and implementation varied. Essential aspects such as compliance measurement and audits to assess guideline effectiveness were neglected in most documents. In conclusion, there is a need for a more consistent approach leading to recommendations based on a thorough evaluation of evidence and applicable worldwide.

The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of the KRG extract on the ILI incidence in healthy adults. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study at the onset of the influenza seasons. A total of 100 subjects 30-70 years of age will be recruited from the general populations. The subjects will be instructed to take 9 capsules per day of either the KRG extract or a placebo for a period of 3 months. The primary outcome measure is to assess the frequency of ILI onset in participated subjects. Secondary variable measures will be included severity and duration of ILI symptoms. The ILI symptoms will be scored by subjects using a 4-point scale. DISCUSSION: This study is a randomized placebo controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the KRG extract compared to placebo and will be provided valuable new information about the clinical and physiological effects of the KRG extract on reduction of ILI incidence including flu and upper respiratory tract infections. The study has been pragmatically designed to ensure that the study findings can be implemented into clinical practice if KRG extract can be shown to be an effective reduction strategy in ILI incidence.

Increased cellular autophagy may kill the infected cell and terminate the infection without proper regulation. The mechanism of autophagy regulation during liver disease progression in HCV infection is unclear. The autophagy research has gained a lot of attention recently since autophagy impairment is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) are three autophagy processes involved in the lysosomal degradation and extracellular release of cytosolic cargoes under excessive stress. Autophagy processes compensate for each other during extreme endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to promote host and microbe survival as well as HCC development in the highly stressed microenvironment of the cirrhotic liver. This review describes the molecular details of how excessive cellular stress generated during HCV infection activates CMA to improve cell survival. The pathological implications of stress-related CMA activation resulting in the loss of hepatic innate immunity and tumor suppressors, which are most often observed among cirrhotic patients with HCC, are discussed. The oncogenic cell programming through autophagy regulation initiated by a cytoplasmic virus may facilitate our understanding of HCC mechanisms related to non-viral etiologies and metabolic conditions such as uncontrolled type II diabetes. We propose that a better understanding of how excessive cellular stress leads to cancer through autophagy modulation may allow therapeutic development and early detection of HCC.",2019-10-24,"Dash, Srikanta; Aydin, Yucel; Moroz, Krzysztof",Cells,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/913eec76aeacee7ccd5410fba9916a25c8491ef8.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6912708.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells8111308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652893/,204908084

However, chronic communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis persist worldwide. Furthermore, emerging new infections such as H1N1 influenza pose a new threat to public health. However, most studies have focused on non-communicable diseases because of their increasing incidence, with fewer studies investigating communicable diseases. Therefore, we estimated the burden of communicable diseases in Korea using national representative 2012 data. To estimate the disability-adjusted life years (DALY), we used cause of death data from the Statistics Korea to estimate the years of life lost (YLL), applied the Korean garbage code algorithm, and used national claims data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) to estimate years lived with disability (YLD). In 2012, the total DALYs of communicable disease were 445 per 100,000, with 129 YLLs per 100,000 and 316 YLDs per 100,000. The total DALYs in men were 468 per 100,000, greater than the 422 per 100,000 DALYs seen in women. The DALYs of lower respiratory infections were the highest value among communicable diseases at 143/100,000 DALYs followed by tuberculosis and upper respiratory infections. The 40-49 years old age group had the largest number of total DALYs. In contrast, the over 80 years old age group had the largest number of total DALYs per 100,000 followed by the 70-79 and 0-9 years old age groups.

The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature to scope and assess the effects of specific strategies for the management of the bodies. METHODS: We searched five general, three Chinese and four coronavirus disease (COVID-19)–specific electronic databases. We searched registries of clinical trials, websites of governmental and other relevant organisations, reference lists of the included papers and relevant systematic reviews, and Epistemonikos for relevant systematic reviews. We included guidance documents providing practical advice on the handling of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Then, we sought primary evidence of any study design reporting on the efficacy and safety of the identified strategies in coronaviruses. We included evidence relevant to contextual factors (ie, acceptability). A single reviewer extracted data using a pilot-tested form and graded the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. A second reviewer verified the data and assessments. RESULTS: We identified one study proposing an uncommon strategy for autopsies for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. The study provided very low-certainty evidence that it reduced the risk of transmission. We identified 23 guidance documents providing practical advice on the steps of handling the bodies: preparation, packing, and others and advice related to both the handling of the dead bodies and the use of personal protective equipment by individuals handling them. We did not identify COVID-19 evidence relevant to any of these steps. CONCLUSION: While a substantive number of guidance documents propose specific strategies, we identified no study providing direct evidence for the effects of any of those strategies.

However, the etiology of ARI is poorly understood in the country. This study aims to describe viral and bacterial infections among children aged younger than 5 years hospitalized with febrile ARI at two hospitals in Niamey, Niger's capital city, and the reported clinical procedures. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study among children aged younger than 5 years hospitalized with febrile ARI at two national hospitals in Niamey between January and December 2015. Clinical presentation and procedures during admission were documented using a standardized case investigation form. Nasopharyngeal specimens collected from each patient were tested for a panel of respiratory viruses and bacteria using the Fast Track Diagnostic 21 Plus kit. RESULTS: We enrolled and tested 638 children aged younger than 5 years, of whom 411 (64.4%) were aged younger than 1 year, and 15 (2.4%) died during the study period. Overall, 496/638 (77.7%) specimens tested positive for at least one respiratory virus or bacterium; of these, 195 (39.3%) tested positive for respiratory viruses, 126 (25.4%) tested positive for respiratory bacteria, and 175 (35.3%) tested positive for both respiratory viruses and bacteria. The predominant viruses detected were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (149/638; 23.3%), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) types 1 to 4 (78/638; 12.2%), human rhinovirus (HRV) (62/638; 9.4%), human adenovirus (HAV) (60/638; 9.4%), and influenza virus (INF) (52/638; 8.1%). Streptococcus pneumoniae (249/638; 39.0%) was the most frequently detected bacterium, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (112/638; 12.2%) and Haemophilus influenzae type B (16/638; 2.5%). Chest X‐rays were performed at the discretion of the attending physician on 301 (47.2%) case patients. Of these patients, 231 (76.7%) had abnormal radiological findings. A total of 135/638 (21.2%) and 572/638 (89.7%) children received antibiotic treatment prior to admission and during admission, respectively.

Herein we discuss the growing evidence suggesting that the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and host may also trigger changes in brain and behavior. Based on the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it is conceivable that changes in endocrine and immune response in the periphery or in the central nervous system may be involved in the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and impaired mental health. This is likely to be further enhanced, since millions of people worldwide are isolated in quarantine to minimize the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and social isolation can also lead to neuroendocrine-immune changes.

Here, we report a novel bat-origin CoV causing severe and fatal pneumonia in humans. METHODS: We collected clinical data and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from five patients with severe pneumonia from Jin Yin-tan Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Nucleic acids of the BAL were extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing. Virus isolation was carried out, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed. RESULTS: Five patients hospitalized from December 18 to December 29, 2019 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation. One of these patients died. Sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown β-CoV strain in all five patients, with 99.8% to 99.9% nucleotide identities among the isolates. These isolates showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843). The virus is phylogenetically closest to a bat SARS-like CoV (SL-ZC45, GenBank MG772933) with 87.6% to 87.7% nucleotide identity, but is in a separate clade. Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8, as a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs. However, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor.

Furthermore, the last quarter century has seen an explosion of new questions and ideas, stimulated by developments in the computer and cognitive sciences. Competing ideas about probability are often driven by different intuitions about the nature of belief that arise from the needs of different domains (e.g., economics, management theory, engineering, medicine, the life sciences etc). Taking medicine as our focus we develop three lines of argument (historical, practical and cognitive) that suggest that traditional views of probability cannot accommodate all the competing demands and diverse constraints that arise in complex real-world domains. A model of uncertain reasoning based on a form of logical argumentation appears to unify many diverse ideas. The model has precursors in informal discussions of argumentation due to Toulmin, and the notion of logical probability advocated by Keynes, but recent developments in artificial intelligence and cognitive science suggest ways of resolving epistemological and technical issues that they could not address.",2003-06-30,"Fox, John",Journal of Applied Logic,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3bd5e582f0bad1859d9f86168684194221a93c50.json,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1570868303000132; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570868303000132,12381630

These structures are called virus replication organelles and consist of two distinct subdomains, the vesicle packets (VPs) and the convoluted membranes (CMs). The VPs are clusters of small vesicle compartments and are considered to be the site of viral genome replication. The CMs are electron-dense amorphous structures observed in proximity to the VPs, but the exact roles of CMs are mostly unknown. Several recent studies have revealed that flaviviruses recruit several host factors that are usually used for the biogenesis of other conventional organelles and usurp their function to generate virus replication organelles.

Here, 354 diarrhoeic samples were collected from yak on 55 farms in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. 22.0% of the diarrhoeic samples were detected as NeVs-positive by RT–PCR assay. Phylogenetic analysis of 78 NeVs RdRp fragments showed that 69 strains were closely related to NB-like strains, and the remaining 9 strains were clustered into an independent branch, which may represent a novel RdRp genotype. Two complete NeVs genomes (YAK/NRG-17/17/CH and YAK/HY1-2/18/CH) were successfully sequenced with 7459 nt and 7460 nt in length, respectively. The genomes of the two strains only shared 68.1%–69.3% nt identity with all six known NeVs genomes, and phylogenetic trees based on its genome, VP1, RdRp, VP2, P34, NTPase, P30, VPg and 3CLpro proteins suggested that the two strains may represent a novel NeVs strain with novel VP1 genotype and novel RdRp genotype. Notably, 11.5% NeVs strains were screened as the novel NeVs strains based VP1 and RdRp sequences. These novel NeVs strains were detected from 6 farms in two counties, indicating that the novel NeVs has spread in local region. To best of our knowledge, this is the first detection of NeVs in yak.

Metformin ameliorated the Th17 inflammaging profile by increasing autophagy and improving mitochondrial bioenergetics.

These sealed eyewears definitely reduce the risk of contamination of eyes. However, there is a constant issue of fogging up of the inner surface that prevents good surgical visibility which can impair surgeons’ performance and their ability to perform fine tasks, especially in operating rooms with temperature and humidity controlled as per the COVID guidelines. We investigated the effectiveness of surface-modified anti-fog polyethylene terephthalate(PET) films and the application of a detergent-based surfactant liquid, applied to the inner aspect of viewing frame, and addition of filtered vents in the prevention of fogging up of the protective eyewears in a simulated operating room environment. METHODS: Ten volunteer orthopedic surgeons tested three modifications of a poly-hydrocarbon based hermetically sealed eyewear as a) application of a surface-modified anti-fog PET film on the inner aspect of eyewear, b) application of a detergent-based surfactant coating on the inner aspect of the protective eyewear, and c) addition of two filtered vents/holes on each side of the protective eyewear, covered with an N95 mask cutting. The testing was performed while completing a synthetic bone-based surgical task in a simulated operating room environment of 24–26° temperature and humidity between 40 and 70%, for a maximum of 2 h. The duration to the loss of clear visibility (ability to read a newspaper) and workable visibility (ability to perform the surgical task) was recorded for each volunteer. RESULTS: The detergent-based surfactant provided the longest duration of clear visibility (69.3 ± 8.16 min) and the workable visibility was maintained for more than 2 h. The second best durations of clear visibility (31.9 ± 3.75 min) and workable visibility (41.6 ± 5.39 min) were provided by the surface-modified anti-fog PET film. The addition of the filtered vents provided only a marginal improvement in the visibility. CONCLUSION: A detergent-based surfactant coating of the viewing surface provides a simple, inexpensive and effective solution to the problem of fogging of the protective eyewears. Besides this, the workable vision is maintained for a prolonged duration.",2020-07-17,"Kumar, Arvind; Qureshi, Owais Ahmed; Arora, Rajesh; Kumar, Sandeep; Jameel, Javed; Khan, Rizwan",J Clin Orthop Trauma,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c7a11c4e5606cd1c8ff59f4dda0965c3c7881798.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9d7f24e37727046edf8b8b966763513bf2a62991.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7366969.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S097656622030309X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S097656622030309X,220602323

Planning for, and responses to, such events must include healthcare and other measures based on current evidence. An important area of infection prevention and control (IPC) is the optimal use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by healthcare workers (HCWs), including masks for protection against respiratory pathogens. Appropriate mask use during routine care is a forerunner to best practice in the event of an outbreak. However, little is known about the influences on decisions and behaviours of HCWs with respect to protective mask use when providing routine care. In this paper we argue that there is a need for more research to provide a better understanding of the decision-making and risk-taking behaviours of HCWs in respect of their use of masks for infectious disease prevention. Our argument is based on the ongoing threat of emerging infectious diseases; a need to strengthen workforce capability, capacity and education; the financial costs of healthcare and outbreaks; and the importance of social responsibility and supportive legislation in planning for global security.

Recently, a homologue of ACE, ACE(2) has been discovered. Both ACE and ACE(2) are emerging as key enzymes of the RAS, where ACE(2) may play a role as negative regulator of ACE. Moreover, ACE(2) appears to be an important enzyme outside the classical RAS, as it hydrolyzes apelins, dynorphin A 1-13, des-Arg-bradykinin and other peptide substrates. The precise interplay between tissue ACE, ACE(2), and their substrates and by-products are presently still unclear. ACE-inhibitors reduce angiotensin II formation and bradykinin degradation, but do not inhibit ACE(2) activity. Moreover, ACE-inhibitors differ in their affinity for tissue ACE, and it has been suggested that tissue ACE affinity might be responsible for some of the beneficial properties of these drugs. ACE-inhibitors also increase nitric oxide availability, and activate several kinases that may regulate protein synthesis by interacting with the nucleus of the cells (outside-in signaling). The outside-in signaling may also be activated by bradykinin itself. Although, the precise significance of the outside-in signaling is still unclear, this new role of ACE-inhibitors may represent a discriminant factor versus angiotensin II receptors antagonists.

There is currently no FDA approved antiviral strategy to alleviate the disease burden. The conserved 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)), which controls coronavirus replication is a promising drug target for combating the coronavirus infection. This study screens some African plants derived alkaloids and terpenoids as potential inhibitors of coronavirus 3CL(pro) using in silico approach. Bioactive alkaloids (62) and terpenoids (100) of plants native to Africa were docked to the 3CL(pro) of the novel SARS-CoV-2. The top twenty alkaloids and terpenoids with high binding affinities to the SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) were further docked to the 3CL(pro) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The docking scores were compared with 3CL(pro)-referenced inhibitors (Lopinavir and Ritonavir). The top docked compounds were further subjected to ADEM/Tox and Lipinski filtering analyses for drug-likeness prediction analysis. This ligand-protein interaction study revealed that more than half of the top twenty alkaloids and terpenoids interacted favourably with the coronaviruses 3CL(pro), and had binding affinities that surpassed that of lopinavir and ritonavir. Also, a highly defined hit-list of seven compounds (10-Hydroxyusambarensine, Cryptoquindoline, 6-Oxoisoiguesterin, 22-Hydroxyhopan-3-one, Cryptospirolepine, Isoiguesterin and 20-Epibryonolic acid) were identified.

In the resulting reports, one of several issues raised for future study was the potential for recombination of virus-vectored vaccines with wild type pathogenic virus strains. This paper presents an assessment of this issue formulated by the Brighton Collaboration. To provide an appropriate context for understanding the potential for recombination of virus-vectored vaccines, we review briefly the current status of virus vectored vaccines, mechanisms of recombination between viruses, experience with recombination involving live attenuated vaccines in the field, and concerns raised previously in the literature regarding recombination of virus-vectored vaccines with wild type virus strains. We then present a discussion of the major variables that could influence recombination between a virus-vectored vaccine and circulating wild type virus and the consequences of such recombination, including intrinsic recombination properties of the parent virus used as a vector; sequence relatedness of vector and wild virus; virus host range, pathogenesis and transmission; replication competency of vector in target host; mechanism of vector attenuation; additional factors potentially affecting virulence; and circulation of multiple recombinant vectors in the same target population.

Prior studies showed that MBL-dependent activation of the complement cascade neutralized insect cell-derived West Nile virus (WNV) in cell culture and restricted pathogenesis in mice. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity of MBL in infection by dengue virus (DENV), a related flavivirus. Using a panel of naïve sera from mouse strains deficient in different complement components, we showed that inhibition of infection by insect cell- and mammalian cell-derived DENV was primarily dependent on the lectin pathway. Human MBL also bound to DENV and neutralized infection of all four DENV serotypes through complement activation-dependent and -independent pathways. Experiments with human serum from naïve individuals with inherent variation in the levels of MBL in blood showed a direct correlation between the concentration of MBL and neutralization of DENV; samples with high levels of MBL in blood neutralized DENV more efficiently than those with lower levels.

While humans are constantly exposed to animal viruses, those that can successfully infect and transmit between humans are exceedingly rare. The key event in zoonosis is when an animal virus begins to replicate (one virion making many) in the first human subject. Only at this point will the animal virus first experience the selective environment of the human body, rendering possible viral adaptation and refinement for humans. In addition, appreciable viral titers in this first human may enable infection of a second, thus initiating selection for viral variants with increased capacity for spread. We assert that host genetics plays a critical role in defining which animal viruses in nature will achieve this key event of replication in a first human host. This is because animal viruses that pose the greatest risk to humans will have few (or no) genetic barriers to replicating themselves in human cells, thus requiring minimal mutations to make this jump.

The urinary antigen test (UAT) is known to be useful for the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of UAT in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV13) era. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases aged ≥19 years were reviewed retrospectively. This study evaluated the utility of Streptococcus pneumoniae UAT (BinaxNOW® assay) for diagnosis of pneumococcal CAP, and the relation of the UAT positive rate to age, comorbidities, pneumonia severity, and pneumococcal serotypes. Among 752 microbiologically identified CAP cases, S. pneumoniae (36.7%) was the most common isolate, and of those cases, 56.4% were positive for UAT. UAT positivity varied by pneumococcal serotype (serotype 3, 50%; 9V/9A, 85%; 11A/11E, 54%; 14, 36.4%; 19A, 50%; and 23F, 37.5%), and was significantly increased since 2012, two years after introduction of PCV13. The positive rate of UAT was significantly related to CRP level (P = 0.007) and lobar pneumonia (P = 0.006), but not to age, co-morbidities or prior antibiotic therapy. In conclusion, urinary antigen detection varied depending on the S. pneumoniae serotype. In the PCV13 era, the serotype distribution of pneumococcal pneumonia may be changing, and the clinical usefulness of UAT needs to be monitored.

The establishment of a persistent infection and the subsequent demyelinating disease triggered by the virus depend on the expression of L*, a viral accessory protein encoded by an alternative open reading frame of the virus. We discovered that L* potently inhibits the interferon-inducible OAS/RNase L pathway. The antagonism of RNase L by L* was particularly prominent in macrophages where baseline oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and RNase L expression levels are elevated, but was detectable in fibroblasts after IFN pretreatment. L* mutations significantly affected Theiler's virus replication in primary macrophages derived from wild-type but not from RNase L-deficient mice. L* counteracted the OAS/RNase L pathway through direct interaction with the ankyrin domain of RNase L, resulting in the inhibition of this enzyme. Interestingly, RNase L inhibition was species-specific as Theiler's virus L* protein blocked murine RNase L but not human RNase L or RNase L of other mammals or birds. Direct RNase L inhibition by L* and species specificity were confirmed in an in vitro assay performed with purified proteins. These results demonstrate a novel viral mechanism to elude the antiviral OAS/RNase L pathway.

However, understanding of the role of respiratory tract microbiota in the clinical course of pediatric CAP is limited. METHODS: We sought to compare microbiota profiles in induced sputum and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) samples from children and to identify microbiota profiles associated with CAP severity. We used 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and several measures of microbiota profiles, including principal component analysis (PCA), to describe the respiratory microbiota in 383 children, 6 months to <18 years, hospitalized with CAP. We examined associations between induced sputum and NP/OP microbiota profiles and CAP severity (hospital length of stay and intensive care unit admission) using logistic regression. RESULTS: Relative abundance of bacterial taxa differed in induced sputum and NP/OP samples. In children 6 months to < 5 years, the sputum PCA factor with high relative abundance of Actinomyces, Veillonella, Rothia, and Lactobacillales was associated with decreased odds of length of stay ≥ 4 days [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.69; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.48–0.99]. The sputum factor with high relative abundance of Haemophilus and Pasteurellaceae was associated with increased odds of intensive care unit admission [aOR 1.52; 95 % CI 1.02–2.26]. In children 5 to < 18 years, the sputum factor with high relative abundance of Porphyromonadaceae, Bacteriodales, Lactobacillales, and Prevotella was associated with increased odds of length of stay ≥ 4 days [aOR 1.52; 95 % CI 1.02–2.26]. Taxa in NP/OP samples were not associated with CAP severity. CONCLUSION: Certain taxa in the respiratory microbiota, which were detected in induced sputum samples, are associated with the clinical course of CAP.

Dog circovirus (DogCV) is a new mammalian circovirus that is considered to be a cause of alimentary syndromes such as diarrhea, vomiting and hemorrhagic enteritis. DogCV has previously only been identified in the United States, Italy, Germany (GeneBank accession number: KF887949) and China (GeneBank accession number: KT946839). Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of DogCV in Taiwan and to explore the correlation between diarrhea and DogCV infection. Clinical specimens were collected between 2012 and 2014 from 207 dogs suffering from diarrhea and 160 healthy dogs. RESULTS: In this study, we developed a sensitive and specific SYBR Green-based real-time PCR assays to detected DogCV in naturally infected animals. Of the analyzed fecal samples from diarrheal dogs and health dogs, 58 (28.0 %) and 19 (11.9 %), respectively, were DogCV positive. The difference in DogCV prevalence was highly significant (P = 0.0002755) in diarrheal dogs. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to reveal that DogCV is currently circulating in domestic dogs in Taiwan and to demonstrate its high detection rate in dogs with diarrhea.

Using sequential plasma samples collected over three years post-infection in a cohort of MSM HIV-1 seroconvertors, we determined the early kinetics of cytokine levels during FiebigI-IV stages using Luminex-based multiplex assays. Cytokines were quantified and relationships between cytokines were assessed by Spearman correlation. Compared with HIV-negative MSM, HIV-infected individuals had significantly increased multiple plasma cytokines, including GM-CSF, IFN-α2, IL-12p70, IP-10 and VEGF, during both acute and chronic stages of infection. Furthermore, rapid disease progressors (RDPs) had earlier and more robust cytokine storms, compared with slow disease progressors (SDPs) (49.6 days vs. 74.9 days, respectively; 6.7-fold vs. 3.7-fold change of cytokines, respectively), suggesting the faster and stronger cytokine storm during AHI could promote disease progression. On the other hand, HIV-1 infection induced more interlocked cytokines network, establishing new strong correlations and imposing a higher rigidity. There were, respectively, 146 (44.9%) statistically significant correlations of cytokines in RDPs and 241 (74.2%) in SDPs (p < 0.001).

In this pilot study, we surveyed 22 captured wild rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus) from the Caribbean island of St. Kitts for 19 microorganisms. Information gained from such surveillance data would be beneficial in assessing regional public health risks and when implementing routine laboratory rodent health monitoring protocols. ABSTRACT: A pilot seroprevalence study was conducted to document exposure to selected pathogens in wild rats inhabiting the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. Serum samples collected from 22 captured wild rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus) were tested for the presence of antibodies to various rodent pathogens using a rat MFI2 serology panel. The samples were positive for cilia-associated respiratory bacillus (13/22; 59.1%), Clostridium piliforme (4/22; 18.2%), Mycoplasma pulmonis (4/22; 18.2%), Pneumocystis carinii (1/22; 4.5%), mouse adenovirus type 2 (16/22; 72.7%), Kilham rat virus (15/22; 68.2%), reovirus type 3 (9/22; 40.9%), rat parvovirus (4/22; 18.2%), rat minute virus (4/22; 18.2%), rat theilovirus (2/22; 9.1%), and infectious diarrhea of infant rats strain of group B rotavirus (rat rotavirus) (1/22; 4.5%). This study provides the first evidence of exposure to various rodent pathogens in wild rats on the island of St. Kitts. Periodic pathogen surveillance in the wild rat population would be beneficial in assessing potential regional zoonotic risks as well as in enhancing the current knowledge when implementing routine animal health monitoring protocols in facilities with laboratory rodent colonies.",2019-05-10,"Boey, Kenneth; Shiokawa, Kanae; Avsaroglu, Harutyun; Rajeev, Sreekumari",Animals (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3442b139e80c8351c89a9398709090db63edb8fe.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6562389.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083284/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani9050228,153311401

Matrine (MAT), a quinolizidine alkaloid derived from the herb Radix Sophorae Flave, has been recently found to suppress clinical EAE and CNS inflammation. However, whether this effect of MAT is through protecting the integrity and function of the BBB is not known. In the present study, we show that MAT treatment had a therapeutic effect comparable to dexamethasone (DEX) in EAE rats, with reduced Evans Blue extravasation, increased expression of collagen IV, the major component of the basement membrane, and the structure of tight junction (TJ) adaptor protein Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Furthermore, MAT treatment attenuated expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and -2 (MMP-9/-2), while it increased the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 and -2 (TIMP-1/-2). Our findings demonstrate that MAT reduces BBB leakage by strengthening basement membrane, inhibiting activities of MMP-2 and -9, and upregulating their inhibitors. Taken together, our results identify a novel mechanism underlying the effect of MAT, a natural compound that could be a novel therapy for MS.",2013-09-08,"Zhang, Su; Kan, Quan-Cheng; Xu, Yuming; Zhang, Guang-Xian; Zhu, Lin",Mediators Inflamm,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3892a126c127795e96e4e071cf14fd7fdc2e4231.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3781841.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/736085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24194630/,13367653

OBJECTIVE: we investigated the presence of virus and the expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, TLR7, and interferon and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in healthy mucosal tissue of control subjects and the inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue of CRS patients, and evaluated whether levels of interferons and ISGs might be affected by CRS-related cytokines and by treatment with macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 and TLR7 agonists. METHODS: The presence of virus in the sinonasal mucosa was evaluated with real-time PCR. The expression of interferons and ISGs in the sinonasal mucosa and in cultured epithelial cells treated with T(H)1 and T(H)2 cytokines, macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 and TLR7 agonists were evaluated with real-time PCR and Western blotting. The expression of TLR3 and TLR7 in the sinonasal mucosa were evaluated with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were detected in 15% of samples. Interferons and ISGs are expressed in normal mucosa, but their levels were decreased in patients with CRS. Interferon and ISG levels were upregulated in cells treated with macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 agonist, but some were decreased in cytokine-treated cells. TLR3 and TLR7 levels showed no significant difference between normal and inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that decreased levels of interferons and ISGs in patients with CRS might contribute to impairment of the antiviral innate response in inflammatory sinonasal epithelial cells.

Paracetamol is as an analgesic and antipyretic; chlorphenamine is an antihistamine; and phenylephrine, a vasoconstrictor and decongestant. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of paracetamol, chlorphenamine and phenylephrine in the symptomatic treatment of the common cold and flu-like syndrome in adults. METHODS: This study enrolled 146 individuals aged 18 to 60 years who had moderate to severe flu-like syndrome or common cold. After clinical examination and laboratory tests, individuals were randomly assigned to receive the fixed-dose combination (73) or placebo (73), five capsules per day for 48 to 72 hours. The primary efficacy endpoint was the sum of the scores of 10 symptoms on a four-point Likert-type scale. To evaluate treatment safety, the occurrence of adverse events was also measured. RESULTS: Mean age was 33.5 (±9.5) years in the placebo group and 33.8 (±11.5) in the treatment group. There were 55 women and 18 men in the placebo group, and 46 women and 27 men in the treatment group. Comparison of overall symptom scores in the two groups revealed a significantly greater reduction in the treatment group than in the placebo group (p = 0.015). Analysis at the first 13 dose intervals (± 66 h of treatment) showed a greater reduction of symptom scores in the treatment group than in the placebo group (p < 0.05). The number and distribution of adverse events were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: A fixed-dose combination of paracetamol, chlorphenamine and phenylephrine was safe and more effective than placebo in the symptomatic treatment of the common cold or flu-like syndrome in adults.

It is a response to various diseases of variable etiology, including SARS-CoV infection. To date, a comprehensive study of the genomic physiopathology of ARDS (and SARS) is lacking, primarily due to the difficulty of finding suitable materials to study the disease process at a tissue level (instead of blood, sputa or swaps). Hereby we attempt to provide such study by analyzing autopsy lung samples from patient who died of SARS and showed different degrees of severity of the pulmonary involvement. We performed real-time quantitative PCR analysis of 107 genes with functional roles in inflammation, coagulation, fibrosis and apoptosis; some key genes were confirmed at a protein expression level by immunohistochemistry and correlated to the degree of morphological severity present in the individual samples analyzed. Significant expression levels were identified for ANPEP (a receptor for CoV), as well as inhibition of the STAT1 pathway, IFNs production and CXCL10 (a T-cell recruiter). Other genes unassociated to date with ARDS/SARS include C1Qb, C5R1, CASP3, CASP9, CD14, CD68, FGF7, HLA-DRA, IGF1, IRF3, MALAT-1, MSR1, NFIL3, SLPI, USP33, CLC, GBP1 and TAC1. As a result, we proposed to therapeutically target some of these genes with compounds such as ANPEP inhibitors, SLPI and dexamethasone.

Benefits of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 infection have been proposed and clinical trials are underway. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, typically used for the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases, have been considered for off-label use in several countries. In the literature, there are reports of ototoxic effects of the drugs causing damage to the inner ear structures, which then result in hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or imbalance. This mini-review represents a summary of the findings from a systematic search regarding ototoxicity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the published literature. The characteristics of sensorineural hearing loss and/or tinnitus after chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine treatment can be temporary but reports of persistent auditory and vestibular dysfunction exist. These are not frequent, but the impact can be substantial. Additionally, abnormal cochleovestibular development in the newborn was also reported after chloroquine treatment in pregnant women. The suggested dose of chloroquine for COVID-19 infection is considerably higher than the usual dosage for malaria treatment; therefore, it is plausible that the ototoxic effects will be greater. There are potential implications from this review for survivors of COVID-19 treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Patient reports of hearing loss, tinnitus, or imbalance should be noted. Those with troublesome hearing loss, tinnitus and/or imbalance are encouraged to be referred for hearing evaluation and interventions once they are stable. Clinical trials of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine should also consider including audiological monitoring in the protocol.",2020-05-29,"Prayuenyong, Pattarawadee; Kasbekar, Anand V.; Baguley, David M.",Front Public Health,,#613347,,document_parses/pdf_json/93669fa532a12d5f0d80a1449c05bfbccf04d342.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7273970.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32574312/,218981523

It is the leading cause of death in HIV patients in Asia and Africa. No major advance has been made in the treatment of CM since the 1970s. The mainstays of induction therapy are amphotericin B and flucytosine, but these are often poorly available where the disease burden is highest. Adjunctive treatments, such as dexamethasone, have had dramatic effects on mortality in other neurologic infections, but are untested in CM. Given the high death rates in patients receiving current optimal treatment, and the lack of new agents on the horizon, adjuvant treatments, which offer the potential to reduce mortality in CM, should be tested. The principal research question posed by this study is as follows: does adding dexamethasone to standard antifungal therapy for CM reduce mortality? Dexamethasone is a cheap, readily available, and practicable intervention. METHOD: A double-blind placebo-controlled trial with parallel arms in which patients are randomised to receive either dexamethasone or placebo, in addition to local standard of care. The study recruits patients in both Asia and Africa to ensure the relevance of its results to the populations in which the disease burden is highest. The 10-week mortality risk in the control group is expected to be between 30% and 50%, depending on location, and the target hazard ratio of 0.7 corresponds to absolute risk reductions in mortality from 30% to 22%, or from 50% to 38%. Assuming an overall 10-week mortality of at least 30% in our study population, recruitment of 824 patients will be sufficient to observe the expected number of deaths. Allowing for some loss to follow-up, the total sample size for this study is 880 patients. To generate robust evidence across both continents, we aim to recruit roughly similar numbers of patients from each continent. The primary end point is 10-week mortality.

While respiratory disease is common in both S. choleraesuis and PRRSV infections, the factors that contribute to its development remain largely undefined. We investigated the interaction of PRRSV, S. choleraesuis, and stress in 5-week-old swine. All combinations of three factors (inoculation with S. choleraesuis on Day 0, PRRSV on Day 3, and treatment with dexamethasone on Days 3–7) were used to produce eight treatment groups in two independent trials. Fecal samples, tonsil and nasal swabs, serum samples and postmortem tissues were collected for bacteriologic and virologic examinations. No clinical signs were observed in pigs inoculated with only PRRSV or only S. choleraesuis. In contrast, pigs which were dually infected with S. choleraesuis and PRRSV exhibited unthriftiness, rough hair coats, dyspnea, and diarrhea. The pigs which received all three treatment factors were the most severely affected and 43% (three of seven) of the animals in this group died. Individuals in this group shed significantly higher quantities of S. choleraesuis in feces and had significantly higher serum PRRSV titers compared to other treatments (p ≤0.05). In addition, S. choleraesuis and PRRSV were shed longer and by more pigs in this group than other groups and S. choleraesuis was recovered from more tissues in this group on Day 21 post inoculation. These results suggested that PRRSV, S. choleraesuis, and dexamethasone acted synergistically to produce a syndrome similar to that observed in the field.",2000-02-29,"Wills, Robert W.; Gray, Jeffery T.; Fedorka-Cray, Paula J.; Yoon, K.-J.; Ladely, Scott; Zimmerman, J.

In animal models anti‐pyretic treatment increases mortality from influenza. We investigated the effects of paracetamol on viral and clinical outcomes in adults with influenza infection. METHODS: This is a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial of adults aged 18–65 years with influenza‐like illness and positive influenza rapid antigen test. Treatments were 1 g paracetamol four times a day, or matching placebo, for 5 days. Pernasal swabs were taken for influenza quantitative RT‐PCR at Baseline and Days 1, 2 and 5. Temperature and symptom scores were recorded for 5–14 days or time of resolution respectively. The primary outcome variable was area under the curve (AUC) for quantitative PCR log(10) viral load from Baseline to Day 5. RESULTS: A total of 80 participants were randomized: no one was lost to follow up, and one withdrew after 4 days. There were 22 and 24 participants who were influenza PCR‐positive in placebo and in paracetamol groups respectively. Mean (SD) AUC PCR log(10) viral load was 4.40 (0.91) in placebo and 4.64 (0.88) in paracetamol; difference was −0.24, 95% CI: −0.78 to 0.29, P = 0.36.

A rapid and accurate diagnostic method is needed for appropriate control, including isolation and treatment of the patients. Here, we report an isothermal, label-free, one-step RNA amplification and detection system, termed as iROAD, for the diagnosis of respiratory diseases. It couples a one-step isothermal RNA amplification method and a bio-optical sensor for simultaneous viral RNA amplification/detection in a label-free and real-time manner. The iROAD assay offers a one-step viral RNA amplification/detection example to rapid analysis (<20 min). The detection limit of iROAD assay was found to be 10-times more sensitive than that of real-time reverse transcription-PCR method. We confirmed the clinical utility of the iROAD assay by detecting viral RNAs obtained from 63 human respiratory samples.

Airborne antibiotic-resistant bacteria could be a potential health crisis as reserve of antibiotic resistance transmission in environment. The composition and antibiotic resistance pattern of culturable bacterial community and how these are affected by air pollution remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the compositions and antibiotic resistance patterns of culturable bacteria in polluted and non-polluted weather conditions in Beijing. METHODS: Air samples were collected indoors and outdoors during polluted and non-polluted weather using six-stage Andersen Samplers. For each isolated bacterium, the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified, sequenced, and blasted against the National Center for Biotechnology Information database Antibiotic resistance was conducted by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Bacterial concentration in polluted weather was significantly higher than in non-polluted weather, both indoors and outdoors (P < 0.05). Gram-positive bacteria (GPB) were dominant in both weathers but gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were more abundant in polluted weather than non-polluted weather both indoors and outdoors. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria occupied 23.7% of all bacterial isolates, 22.4% of isolates from polluted weather and 27.8% of isolates from non-polluted weather. Penicillins were resisted by 72.4% and 83.3% of isolates from polluted and non-polluted weather, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The bacterial concentration was significantly higher in polluted weather, compared to non-polluted weather. Polluted weather is correlated with changes in the bacterial composition in the air, with a greater abundance of GNB. Penicillins was resisted by over 70% of bacterial isolates. The abundance of MDR bacteria suggested potential risks for human health.",2019-07-05,"Mao, Yixin; Ding, Pei; Wang, Youbin; Ding, Cheng; Wu, Liping; Zheng, Ping; Zhang, Xiao; Li, Xia; Wang, Leyao; Sun, Zongke",Environ Int,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/fdebb2b0f78abab06a7b1843831fdaa78c3463f7.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112690.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412019303393; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.104936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284114/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412019303393,195845178

Most patients suffer from bilateral cataract and while cataract surgery of only one eye is effective in restoring functional vision, second-eye surgery leads to further improvements in health-related quality of life, and is cost-effective. At present, most patients undergo cataract surgery in both eyes on separate days as recommended in national guidelines, referred to as delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). An alternative procedure involves operating both eyes on the same day, but as separate procedures, known as immediately sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and costs of ISBCS compared to DSBCS, in order to test the hypothesis that ISBCS is non-inferior to DSBCS in terms of effectiveness and superior to ISBCS in terms of cost-effectiveness. METHODS/DESIGN: Multicenter non-inferiority randomised controlled clinical trial. Patients (18 years or older) with bilateral cataract and an indication for bilateral cataract surgery with an expected uncomplicated intraoperative and postoperative course are included in the study. Patients are randomly assigned to either ISBCS or DSBCS. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with a refractive outcome in the second eye within 1.0 dioptre from the target refraction, at 4 weeks after surgery. Secondary outcomes include corrected and uncorrected distance visual acuity, complications, patient reported outcomes (PROMs), cost-effectiveness, and budget impact. Follow-up visits are planned at 1 week after first-eye surgery and 4 weeks after second-eye surgery. At 3 months after first-eye surgery, the occurrence of complications is checked and patients fill in a final questionnaire. DISCUSSION: This study protocol describes the design of a multicenter non-inferiority randomised controlled trial. Current studies on ISBCS often lack information on safety regarding refractive outcomes. In addition, there is a lack of well-designed cost-effectiveness studies using established methods. The BICAT-NL study will provide more insight in refractive and cost-effectiveness outcomes for ISBCS compared to DSBCS.

This meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of current option of therapies for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) besides COVID-19, in an attempt to identify promising therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and WANFANG DATA for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort, and retrospective cohort studies that evaluated therapies (hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapy, and ribavirin-based therapy, etc.) for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. The primary outcomes were mortality, virological eradication and clinical improvement, and secondary outcomes were improvement of symptoms and chest radiography results, incidence of acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS), utilization of mechanical ventilation, and adverse events (AEs). Summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models, and the quality of evidence was appraised using GRADEpro. Eighteen articles (5 RCTs, 2 prospective cohort studies, and 11 retrospective cohort studies) involving 4,941 patients were included. Compared with control treatment, anti-coronary virus interventions significantly reduced mortality (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.96; I(2) = 81.3%), remarkably ameliorate clinical improvement (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.05-2.19) and radiographical improvement (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.11-2.36, I(2) = 11.0 %), without manifesting clear effect on virological eradication, incidence of ARDS, intubation, and AEs. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids remarkably decreased mortality (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27-0.68). The lopinavir/ritonavir-based combination showed superior virological eradication and radiographical improvement with reduced rate of ARDS. Likewise, hydroxychloroquine improved radiographical result. For safety, ribavirin could induce more bradycardia, anemia and transaminitis. Meanwhile, hydroxychloroquine could increase AEs rate especially diarrhea. Overall, the quality of evidence on most outcomes were very low. In conclusion, although we could not draw a clear conclusion for the recommendation of potential therapies for COVID-19 considering the very low quality of evidence and wide heterogeneity of interventions and indications, our results may help clinicians to comprehensively understand the advantages and drawbacks of each anti-coronavirus agents on efficacy and safety profiles. Lopinavir/ritonavir combinations might observe better virological eradication capability than other anti-coronavirus agents. Conversely, ribavirin might cause more safety concerns especially bradycardia.

While direct person-to-person transmission via respiratory droplets accounted for most cases, other modes have not been ruled out. Faecal shedding is common and prolonged and has caused an outbreak in Hong Kong. We studied the stability of SARS-CoV under different conditions, both in suspension and dried on surfaces, in comparison with other human-pathogenic viruses, including human coronavirus HCoV-229E. In suspension, HCoV-229E gradually lost its infectivity completely while SARS-CoV retained its infectivity for up to 9 days; in the dried state, survival times were 24 h versus 6 days. Thermal inactivation at 56°C was highly effective in the absence of protein, reducing the virus titre to below detectability; however, the addition of 20% protein exerted a protective effect resulting in residual infectivity. If protein-containing solutions are to be inactivated, heat treatment at 60°C for at least 30 min must be used. Different fixation procedures, e.g. for the preparation of immunofluorescence slides, as well as chemical means of virus inactivation commonly used in hospital and laboratory settings were generally found to be effective. Our investigations confirm that it is possible to care for SARS patients and to conduct laboratory scientific studies on SARS-CoV safely.

Understanding the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriage amongst HCWs at work is necessary to inform the development of HCW screening programmes to control nosocomial spread. METHODS: Cross-sectional ‘snapshot’ survey from April-May 2020; HCWs recruited from six UK hospitals. Participants self-completed a health questionnaire and underwent a combined viral nose and throat swab, tested by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 with viral culture on majority of positive samples. FINDINGS: Point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriage across the sites was 2•0% (23/1152 participants), median cycle threshold value 35•70 (IQR:32•42-37•57). 17 were previously symptomatic, two currently symptomatic (isolated anosmia and sore throat); the remainder declared no prior or current symptoms. Symptoms in the past month were associated with threefold increased odds of testing positive (aOR 3•46, 95%CI 1•38-8•67; p=0•008). SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated from only one (5%) of nineteen cultured samples. A large proportion (39%) of participants reported symptoms in the past month. INTERPRETATION: The point-prevalence is similar to previous estimates for HCWs in April 2020, though a magnitude higher than in the general population. Based upon interpretation of symptom history and testing results including viral culture, the majority of those testing positive were unlikely to be infectious at time of sampling. Development of screening programmes must balance the potential to identify additional cases based upon likely prevalence, expanding the symptoms list to encourage HCW testing, with resource implications and risks of excluding those unlikely to be infectious with positive tests.

Methods Between January and December 2011, 637 patients <19 years of age exhibited culture-confirmed adenoviral infection in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and provided specimens available for genotyping by multiplex real-time PCR. Clinical data were collected retrospectively. Results Excluding five cases with multiple genotypes, 632 cases were included for analysis. Three genotypes were identified, including HAdV-3 (429/632; 67.6%), HAdV-7 (144/632; 22.6%) and HAdV-2 (59/632; 9.8%). Median age was 4.58 years (range 2 months to 18 years), with children infected with HAdV-3 significantly older (82.9% >3 years; p <0.001). Of the 621 inpatients, 98.2% had fevers and all exhibited respiratory symptoms, 75 patients (12.1%) had lower respiratory tract infections, 20 (3.2%) required intensive care (HAdV-2: 1; HAdV-3: 8; and HAdV-7: 11), and three died (all HAdV-7-infected). HAdV-3-infected patients were significantly more likely to have upper respiratory symptoms and a high serum C-reactive protein level >100 mg/L, whereas leucocytosis (white blood cell count >15 000/mm3) was more common in HAdV-2-infected patients (p 0.007). HAdV-7 infections were significantly associated with a longer duration of fever, leucopenia (white blood cell count <5000/mm3), thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 000/mm3), lower respiratory tract infections, a longer length of hospital stay, and requiring intensive care (all p <0.001).

Results showed a correlation between the responses to chloroquine and NH(4)Cl, a lysosomotropic agent known to increase the pH of intracellular vesicles. Time-of-addition experiments showed that the inhibitory effect of chloroquine was maximal when the drug had been added at the time of infection and was lost after 2 h post-infection. This timing approximately corresponds to that of virus/cell fusion. Moreover, there was a clear correlation between the EC(50 )of chloroquine in vitro and the electrostatic potential of the HA subunit (HA2) mediating the virus/cell fusion process.

(Odds Ratio 6.02 by LR; Hazard Ratio 2.28 by CRR). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates acute stroke is the most common neuroimaging finding among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Detection of an acute stroke is a strong prognostic marker of poor outcome.

These patients are vulnerable and susceptible to the environment surrounding them, yet there is little information available on indoor air quality and factors affecting it within a PICU. To address this gap in knowledge we conducted continuous indoor and outdoor airborne particle concentration measurements over a two-week period at the Royal Children's Hospital PICU in Brisbane, Australia, and we also collected 82 bioaerosol samples to test for the presence of bacterial and viral pathogens. Our results showed that both 24-hour average indoor particle mass (PM(10)) (0.6–2.2 μg m(− 3), median: 0.9 μg m(− 3)) and submicrometer particle number (PN) (0.1–2.8 × 10(3) p cm(− 3), median: 0.67 × 10(3) p cm(− 3)) concentrations were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the outdoor concentrations (6.7–10.2 μg m(− 3), median: 8.0 μg m(− 3) for PM(10) and 12.1–22.2 × 10(3) p cm(− 3), median: 16.4 × 10(3) p cm(− 3) for PN). In general, we found that indoor particle concentrations in the PICU were mainly affected by indoor particle sources, with outdoor particles providing a negligible background. We identified strong indoor particle sources in the PICU, which occasionally increased indoor PN and PM(10) concentrations from 0.1 × 10(3) to 100 × 10(3) p cm(− 3), and from 2 μg m(− 3) to 70 μg m(− 3), respectively. The most substantial indoor particle sources were nebulization therapy, tracheal suction and cleaning activities. The average PM(10) and PN emission rates of nebulization therapy ranged from 1.29 to 7.41 mg min(− 1) and from 1.20 to 3.96 p min(− 1) × 10(11), respectively. Based on multipoint measurement data, it was found that particles generated at each location could be quickly transported to other locations, even when originating from isolated single-bed rooms. The most commonly isolated bacterial genera from both primary and broth cultures were skin commensals while viruses were rarely identified.

A ‘pat7’ motif of 41-PGKK(N/S)KK has previously been identified in the N protein as the functional nuclear localization signal (NLS); however, the biological consequences of N protein nuclear localization are unknown. In the present study, the role of N protein nuclear localization during infection was investigated in pigs using an NLS-null mutant virus. When two lysines at 43 and 44 at the NLS locus were substituted to glycines, the modified NLS with 41-PGGGNKK restricted the N protein to the cytoplasm. This NLS-null mutation was introduced into a full-length infectious cDNA clone of PRRSV. Upon transfection of cells, the NLS-null full-length clone induced cytopathic effects and produced infectious progeny. The NLS-null virus grew to a titer 100-fold lower than that of wild-type virus. To examine the response to NLS-null PRRSV in the natural host, three groups of pigs, consisting of seven animals per group, were intranasally inoculated with wild-type, placebo, or NLS-null virus, and the animals were maintained for 4 weeks. The NLS-null-infected pigs had a significantly shorter mean duration of viremia than wild-type-infected pigs but developed significantly higher titers of neutralizing antibodies. Mutations occurred at the NLS locus in one pig during viremia, and four types of mutations were identified: 41-PGRGNKK, 41-PGGRNKK, and 41-PGRRNKK, and 41-PGKKSKK. Both wild-type and NLS-null viruses persisted in the tonsils for at least 4 weeks, and the NLS-null virus persisting in the tonsils was found to be mutated to either 41-PGRGNKK or 41-PGGRNKK in all pigs. No other mutation was found in the N gene. All types of reversions which occurred during viremia and persistence were able to translocate the mutated N proteins to the nucleus, indicating a strong selection pressure for reversion at the NLS locus of the N protein in vivo. Reversions from NLS-null to functional NLS in the tonsils suggest a possible correlation of viral persistence with N protein nuclear localization. These results show that N protein nuclear localization is non-essential for PRRSV multiplication but may play an important role in viral attenuation and in pathogenesis in vivo.",2006-03-01,"Lee, Changhee; Hodgins, Douglas; Calvert, Jay G.; Welch, Siao-Kun W.; Jolie, Rika; Yoo, Dongwan",Virology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7eb3271edf4fcf06bf7e90037352aca7c2c26ea2.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172752.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682205007464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16330065/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682205007464,45589135

Viral infection is associated with both direct (invasive disease) and indirect (immune modulation) effects affecting susceptibility to other infections and promoting allograft rejection. The transplantation recipient is susceptible to a broad array of viral pathogens. Some may be transmitted with the allograft as donor-derived infections, while others result from exposure, either soon after the transplant or from more distant exposures when infection is latent and reactivates in the setting of immune suppression. Simultaneous infections with multiple viral or viral and nonviral pathogens are common. The risk for viral infection is a function of the intensity of exposure and virulence of the specific virus, the intensity of immune suppression used to prevent graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease, underlying immune deficits, and factors affecting host susceptibility. Studies of viral latency, reactivation, and of the cellular effects of viral infection will provide clues for future strategies in prevention and treatment of viral infections.

Overall, the KM22 genome sequence is more similar to the genome sequences of the strains isolated from animals than the strains isolated from humans. The majority of virulence gene expression in Bordetella is positively regulated by the two-component sensory transduction system BvgAS. bopN, bvgA, fimB, and fimC were the most highly conserved BvgAS-regulated genes present in all seven strains analyzed. In contrast, the BvgAS-regulated genes present in all seven strains with the highest sequence divergence werefimN, fim2, fhaL, andfhaS. A total of eight major fimbrial subunit genes were identified in KM22. Quantitative real-time PCR data demonstrated that seven of the eight fimbrial subunit genes identified in KM22 are expressed and regulated by BvgAS. The annotation of the KM22 genome sequence, coupled with the comparative genomic analyses reported in this study, can be used to facilitate the development of vaccines with improved efficacy towards B. bronchiseptica in swine to decrease the prevalence and disease burden caused by this pathogen.",2016-01-15,"Nicholson, Tracy L.; Shore, Sarah M.; Register, Karen B.; Bayles, Darrell O.; Kingsley, Robert A.; Brunelle, Brian W.",Veterinary Microbiology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/1bf6de18aec2c9d092d17543fba178914aca2cfa.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117204.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515300675; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.10.026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515300675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26711033/,22717191

Citizens also have expectations about the role that health care plays in enjoying a good quality of life, by providing response systems to handle emergencies and other illness situations adequately. Among the systems required to support desired performance levels is a robust and resilient pharmaceutical supply chain that is free of disruption. Shortages of drugs place undue pressure on healthcare providers to devise alternative approaches to administer patient care. With climate change expected to result in increasingly severe weather patterns in the future, it is critical that logistics engineers understand the impact that a catastrophic weather event could have on supply chain disruption to facilitate the design of supply systems that are robust and resilient. This study investigates the main causal and intermediate events that led to risk propagation in, and disruption of, the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain following Hurricane Maria. A causality Bayesian model is developed to depict linkages between risk events and quantify the associated cumulative risk. The quantification is further examined through different advanced techniques such as predictive inference reasoning and sensitivity analysis.

Understanding the determinants of e-grocery shopping is important for grocers, supply chain managers, and urban planners. In this context, we first explore how deliveries from online shopping have been changing over time. From our analysis of the 2009 and 2017 National Household Travel Surveys, we found that online shopping has been embraced by increasingly diverse households, although income, education, and some racial/ethnic differences persist. Our analysis of the 2017 American Time Use Survey shows that Americans are 24 times more likely to shop for groceries in stores than online. Moreover, in-store grocery shoppers are more likely to be female and unemployed, but less likely to belong to younger generations, to have less than a college degree, or to be African American. The gender imbalance in grocery shopping is larger online than in stores, but e-grocery shoppers do not otherwise differ from the general population.

We present here a comprehensive, Canada-specific surveillance summary of illness in a cohort of returned Canadian travellers and new immigrants. METHODS: We extracted and analyzed (using standard parametric and nonparametric techniques) data from the Canadian Travel Medicine Network (CanTravNet) database for ill returned Canadian travellers and new immigrants who presented to a Canadian GeoSentinel Surveillance Network site between September 2009 and September 2011. RESULTS: During the study period, 4365 travellers and immigrants presented to a CanTravNet site, 3943 (90.3%) of whom were assigned a travel-related diagnosis. Among the 3115 non-immigrant travellers with a definitive travel-related diagnosis, arthropod bite (n = 127 [4.1%]), giardiasis (n = 91 [2.9%]), malaria (n = 77 [2.5%]), latent tuberculosis (n = 73 [2.3%]), and strongyloidiasis (n = 66 [2.1%]) were the most common specific etiologic diagnoses. Among the 828 immigrants with definitive travel-related diagnoses, the most frequent etiologies were latent tuberculosis (n = 229 [27.7%]), chronic hepatitis B (n = 182 [22.0%]), active tuberculosis (n = 97 [11.7%]), chronic hepatitis C (n = 89 [10.7%]), and strongyloidiasis (n = 41 [5.0%]). Potentially serious infections, such as dengue fever (61 cases) and enteric fever due to Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi or Paratyphi (36 cases), were common. Individuals travelling for the purpose of visiting friends and relatives (n = 500 [11.6% of those with known reason for travel]) were over-represented among those diagnosed with malaria and enteric fever, compared with other illnesses (for malaria 34/94 [36.2%] v. 466/4221 [11.0%]; for enteric fever, 17/36 [47.2%] v. 483/4279 [11.3%]) (both p < 0.001). For cases of malaria, there was also overrepresentation (compared with other illnesses) from business travellers (22/94 [23.4%] v. 337/4221 [8.0%]) and males (62/94 [66.0%] v. 1964/4269 [46.0%]) (both p < 0.001). Malaria was more likely than other illnesses to be acquired in sub-Saharan Africa (p < 0.001), whereas dengue was more likely than other illnesses to be imported from the Caribbean and South East Asia (both p = 0.003) and enteric fever from South Central Asia (24/36 [66.7%]) (p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: This analysis of surveillance data on ill returned Canadian travellers has detailed the spectrum of imported illness within this cohort. It provides an epidemiologic framework for Canadian practitioners encountering ill returned travellers. We have confirmed that travel to visit friends and relatives confers particularly high risks, which underscores the need to improve pretravel intervention for a population that is unlikely to seek specific pretravel advice. Potentially serious and fatal illnesses such as malaria and enteric fever were common, as were illnesses of public health importance, such as tuberculosis and hepatitis B.",2014-02-11,"Boggild, Andrea K; Geduld, Jennifer; Libman, Michael; Ward, Brian J; McCarthy, Anne E; Doyle, Patrick W; Ghesquiere, Wayne; Vincelette, Jean; Kuhn, Susan; Freedman, David O; Kain, Kevin C",Open Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/22238e30828eb4613d777bea7bd3ff321aae450c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4085092.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009682/,30407352

RESULTS: Of the 44 clinicians surveyed, 33 responded, representing a total of 356 years of specialist practice (mean 10.8 years). Although 70% of respondents had made use of threats of formal detention in dealing with non-compliant patients, only one formal detention under statutory powers was identified. Infrastructural and legal concerns with the use of detention were common. There was widespread support for a broadening of the range of additional public health powers, including a power of prolonged detention in the setting of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis.

This dichotomy is exemplified by cathepsin L (CTSL), which helps Hendra virus and SARS coronavirus to invade cells, but is essential for survival in mice with mycoplasma pneumonia. The present study tested the hypothesis that CTSL protects mice from serious consequences of infection by the orthomyxovirus influenza A, which is thought to be activated by host-supplied proteases other than CTSL. Ctsl(-/-) mice infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1) had larger lung viral loads and higher mortality than infected Ctsl(+/+) mice. Lung inflammation in surviving infected mice peaked 14 days after initial infection, accompanied marked focal distal airway bronchiolization and epithelial metaplasia followed by desquamation and fibrotic interstitial remodeling, and persisted for at least 6 weeks. Most deaths occurred during the second week of infection in both groups of mice. In contrast to mycoplasma pneumonia, infiltrating cells were predominantly mononuclear rather than polymorphonuclear. The histopathology of lung inflammation and remodeling in survivors was similar in Ctsl(-/-) and Ctsl(+/+) mice, although Ctsl(+/+) mice cleared immunoreactive virus sooner. Furthermore, Ctsl(-/-) mice had profound deficits in CD4+ lymphocytes before and after infection and weaker production of pathogen-specific IgG. Thus, CTSL appears to support innate as well as adaptive responses, which confer a survival advantage on mice infected with the orthomyxovirus influenza A.",2016-10-07,"Xu, Xiang; Greenland, John R.; Gotts, Jeffrey E.; Matthay, Michael A.; Caughey, George H.",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4f695bec496fb166d09c3377627d86cc587c2f27.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5055332.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27716790/,15178597

The etiological diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections is difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to use Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay tests in a routine setting for exact and fast identification. OBJECTIVES: In this paper, we present the clinical results of pediatric pneumonia and describe their etiology by using molecular diagnosis. Study design: Tracheal secretion was collected from infants presenting respiratory distress isolated or associated with systemic signs, attending the unit of Neonatology between December 1, 2016, and Mai 31, 2018. Samples were tested with the multiplex RespiFinder® SMART 22 FAST which potentially detects 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. RESULTS: Of the 86 infants considered in this study (mean age 31 ± 19 days) suspected of acute respiratory tract infections, 71 (83%) were positive for one or multiple viruses or/and bacteria. The majority of acute respiratory tract infections had a viral origin (95%): respiratory syncytial viruses (A and B) (49%), rhinovirus (21%), coronaviruses 229E (11%), humain metapneumovirus (5%), influenza A (3%), influenza H1N1 (1%), adenovirus (2%), and parainfluenza virus type 4 (2%). Among our patients, 6% had Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Coinfections were not associated with severe respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: The clinical spectrum of respiratory infections is complex and often nonspecific. Thus, the early and fast detection of related causative agents is crucial. The use of multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction may help choose an accurate treatment, reduce the overall use of unnecessary antibiotics, preserve intestinal flora, and decrease nosocomial infection by reducing the length of hospitalization.",2020-02-18,"Hattoufi, Kenza; Tligui, Houssain; Obtel, Majdouline; El Ftouh, Sobha; Kharbach, Aicha; Barkat, Amina",Adv Virol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7e0925a800d4d09380ac44584b5be257d83531d3.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7049438.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/6212643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32148499/,212552085

However, the traditional manufacturing methods suffer from many drawbacks such as multiple steps, harsh conditions, low yield, and environmental problems, which hamper further applications of petrochemical-based acetylacetone. Compared to conventional chemical methods, biosynthetic methods possess advantages such as being eco-friendly, and having mild conditions, high selectivity and low potential costs. It is urgent to develop biosynthetic route for acetylacetone to avoid the present problems. RESULTS: The biosynthetic pathway of acetylacetone was constructed by reversing its biodegradation route, and the acetylacetone was successfully produced by engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli) by overexpression of acetylacetone-cleaving enzyme (Dke1) from Acinetobacter johnsonii. Several promising amino acid residues were selected for enzyme improvement based on sequence alignment and structure analysis, and the acetylacetone production was improved by site-directed mutagenesis of Dke1. The double-mutant (K15Q/A60D) strain presented the highest acetylacetone-producing capacity which is 3.6-fold higher than that of the wild-type protein. Finally, the strain accumulated 556.3 ± 15.2 mg/L acetylacetone in fed-batch fermentation under anaerobic conditions.

Since a majority of the SARS-CoV-2 deaths are due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a strategy to mitigate the same could save countless lives. Since SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS has a strong immunological component, many investigators are utilizing monoclonal antibodies against IL-6, TNF-alpha and CCR5. However, targeting a single cytokine with an expensive monoclonal antibody could be a less pragmatic approach. We propose the use of cyclophosphamide as an immunomodulator, given its proven role in various settings including autoimmune diseases, and in the post-haploidentical stem cell transplant. Cyclophosphamide could deplete cytotoxic and effector T cell populations while relatively sparing the regulatory T cells (Tregs).

These primordial cells shared a hostile anaerobic and overheated environment and competed for survival. “Coexist with, or subdue and conquer, expropriate its most useful possessions, or symbiose with it, your competitor” remain cellular life’s basic rules. This author emphasizes the role of viruses, both in mediating cell fusions, such as the formation of the first eukaryotic cell(s) from a united crenarchaeon and prokaryota, and the transfer of host cell genes integrated into viral (phages) genomes. After rising above the Darwinian threshold, rigid rules of speciation and vertical inheritance in the three domains of life were established, but horizontal gene transfers with or without cell fusions were never abolished. The author proves with extensive, yet highly selective documentation, that not only unicellular microorganisms, but the most complex multicellular entities of the highest ranks resort to, and practice, cell fusions, and donate and accept horizontally (laterally) transferred genes. Cell fusions and horizontally exchanged genetic materials remain the fundamental attributes and inherent characteristics of the living matter, whether occurring accidentally or sought after intentionally. These events occur to cells stagnating for some 3 milliard years at a lower yet amazingly sophisticated level of evolution, and to cells achieving the highest degree of differentiation, and thus functioning in dependence on the support of a most advanced multicellular host, like those of the human brain.

METHODS: We introduce a multi-host stochastic metapopulation model with two age classes to analytically investigate the role of a heterogeneously mixing population and its associated non-homogeneous travel behaviors on the risk of a major epidemic. We inform the model with demographic data, contact data and travel statistics of Europe and Mexico, and calibrate it to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic early outbreak. We allow for variations of the model parameters to explore the conditions of invasion under different scenarios. RESULTS: We derive the expression for the potential of global invasion of the epidemic that depends on the transmissibility of the pathogen, the transportation network and mobility features, the demographic profile and the mixing pattern. Higher assortativity in the contact pattern greatly increases the probability of spatial containment of the epidemic, this effect being contrasted by an increase in the social activity of adults vs. children. Heterogeneous features of the mobility network characterizing its topology and traffic flows strongly favor the invasion of the pathogen at the spatial level, as also a larger fraction of children traveling. Variations in the demographic profile and mixing habits across countries lead to heterogeneous outbreak situations. Model results are compatible with the H1N1 spatial transmission dynamics observed. CONCLUSIONS: This work illustrates the importance of considering age-dependent mixing profiles and mobility features coupled together to study the conditions for the spatial invasion of an emerging influenza pandemic. Its results allow the immediate assessment of the risk of a major epidemic for a specific scenario upon availability of data, and the evaluation of the potential effectiveness of public health interventions targeting specific age groups, their interactions and mobility behaviors.

Related clinical features are needed. METHODS: We reviewed 69 patients who were hospitalized in Union hospital in Wuhan between January 16 to January 29, 2020. All patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the final date of follow-up was February 4, 2020. RESULTS: The median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years (IQR 35.0-62.0), and 32 patients (46%) were men. The most common symptoms were fever (60[87%]), cough (38[55%]), and fatigue (29[42%]). Most patients received antiviral therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients). As of February 4, 2020, 18 (26.9%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and five patients had died, with a mortality rate of 7.5%.

E64d, a specific, irreversible inhibitor of cysteine (thiol) proteinases, inhibits the processing of the gene 1 polyprotein. Specifically, E64d blocks the carboxy-terminal cleavage of p65, E64d also inhibits replication of MHV-A59 in murine DBT cells in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced virus titers and viral syncytia formation. This inhibition of replication is associated with a rapid shutoff of new viral RNA synthesis, in a manner similar to that seen in the presence of cycloheximide. The E64d-associated inhibition of RNA synthesis likely results from E64d-specific inhibition of processing of the gene 1 polyprotein, resulting in inactive proteinase or replicase proteins.

In addition, about 82 million metric tons of eggs were produced. One of the bases for this production is the reproductive efficiency of today's poultry. This, in turn, is due to their inherent reproductive physiology, intensive genetic selection and advances in husbandry/management. The system of reproduction in males in largely similar to that in mammals except that there is no descent of testes. In females, there are marked differences with there being a single ovary and oviduct; the latter being the name of the differentiated entire Müllerian duct. Moreover, females produce eggs with a yolky oocyte surrounded by albumen, membranes and shell. Among the most successful reproductive management techniques are optimizing photoperiod, light intensity and nutrition. Widespread employment of these has allowed maximizing production. Laying hens can be re-cycled toward the end egg production. Other aspects of reproductive management in poultry include the following: artificial insemination (almost exclusively employed in turkeys) and approaches to reduce broodiness together with cage free (colony), conventional, enriched and free-range systems.",2020-12-31,"Scanes, Colin G.; Butler, Leasea D.; Kidd, Michael T.",Animal Agriculture,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7a5aa39108c02e8baa292d13d13466c52a2c96e7.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153309.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128170526000203; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128170526000203,214189934

Acute liver failure is the common final pathway of a multitude of conditions and insults, all of which result in massive hepatic necrosis or loss of normal hepatic function. The ensuing multiorgan system failure frequently has a fatal outcome, with mortality rates in most series ranging from approximately 55% to 95% [1]. Acute liver failure (ALF, previously often referred to as fulminant hepatic failure (FHF)) knows no age boundaries, with many cases occurring in those younger than 30 years. Short of excellent intensive care unit (ICU) support and liver transplantation in selected cases, few viable treatment options are available. Over the past few decades, however, survival has been improved by anticipation, recognition, and early treatment of associated complications, as well as the application of prognostic criteria for early identification of patients requiring liver transplantation (along with improvement in the techniques and science of transplantation itself). The etiology of ALF varies from country to country and the incidence change over time. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) has now replaced viral hepatitis as the leading cause of ALF [2]. In a study from London including 310 patients with ALF in the period 1994–2004, 42% of the cases were caused by paracetamol [3], whereas this was only the cause in 2% of 267 patients in Spain from 1992 to 2000 [4].

Recent studies demonstrated that PEDF displays cytoprotective activity in several cell types. However, it remains unknown whether PEDF is involved in glucocorticoid-induced osteoblast death. The aim of this study was to examine the role of PEDF in osteoblast survival in response to dexamethasone, an active glucocorticoid analogue, and explore the underlying mechanism. In the present study, dexamethasone (DEX) was used to induce MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast apoptosis. PEDF mRNA and protein levels and cell apoptosis were determined respectively. Then PEDF receptor (PEDF-R)- and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-related signal transductions were assessed. Here we show that DEX down-regulates PEDF expression, which contributes to osteoblast apoptosis. As a result, exogenous recombinant PEDF (rPEDF) inhibited DEX-induced cell apoptosis. We confirmed that PEDF-R was expressed on MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast membrane and could bind to PEDF which increased the level of LPA and activated the phosphorylation of Akt.

Treg cells showed a reduced proliferation rate and their frequency is progressively reduced along infection compared to effector T (Teff) cells. Also, a higher fraction of Treg cells showed a naïve phenotype, meanwhile Teff cells were mostly of the effector memory type.

Furthermore, endogenous glucocorticoids released in response to T. cruzi-driven immune activation were crucial to sustain the Treg/Teff cell balance.

A novel coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. This virus represents a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with more than 1,948,617 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 121,846 deaths worldwide. Currently, no specific medication is recommended to treat COVID-19 patients. However, governments and pharmaceutical companies are struggling to quickly find an effective drug to defeat the coronavirus. In the current review, we summarize the existing state of knowledge about COVID-19, available medications, and treatment options. Favilavir is an antiviral drug that is approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now approved to treat symptoms of COVID-19 in China.

Changes in the tissue-specific exosomal protein expression may underlie pathological conditions whereby extracellular matrix turnover and homeostasis is disrupted. Ocular hypertension due to extracellular matrix accumulation in the trabecular meshwork is a hallmark of glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma. In the trabecular meshwork, exosomal fibronectin mediates cell matrix interactions at cellular structures called “invadosomes”. Trabecular meshwork cells use invadosomes to turn over their surrounding matrix and maintain passageways for flow of aqueous humor. In this study, we observed that human trabecular meshwork explants treated with dexamethasone released exosomes with significantly reduced amounts of fibronectin bound per exosome. Further, we found that exosome-fibronectin binding is heparan sulfate-dependent, consistent with our observation that trabecular meshwork exosomes are enriched in the heparin/heparan sulfate binding annexins A2 and A6. In this way, dexamethasone-treated explants released exosomes with a significant reduction in annexin A2 and A6 per exosome. Interestingly, we did not detect exosomal matrix metalloproteinases, but we identified abundant dipeptidyl peptidase 4, a serine protease whose activity was reduced on exosomes isolated from dexamethasone-treated explants. Together, our findings demonstrate mechanistically how corticosteroid-induced alterations in exosomal adhesion cargo and properties can account for the pathological matrix accumulation seen in many glaucoma patients.",2016-10-26,"Dismuke, W.

Existing interferon-signaling/receptor-deficient mouse models may not be suitable for evaluating treatment effects of recombinant interferons. METHODS: We developed a novel mouse model for ZIKV infection by immunosuppressing BALB/c mice with dexamethasone. RESULTS: Dexamethasone-immunosuppressed male mice (6–8 weeks) developed disseminated infection as evidenced by the detection of ZIKV-NS1 protein expression and high viral loads in multiple organs. They had ≥ 10% weight loss and high clinical scores soon after dexamethasone withdrawal (10 dpi), which warranted euthanasia at 12 dpi. Viral loads in blood and most tissues at 5 dpi were significantly higher than those at 12 dpi (P < 0.05). Histological examination revealed prominent inflammatory infiltrates in multiple organs, and CD45 + and CD8 + inflammatory cells were seen in the testis. These findings suggested that clinical deterioration occurred during viral clearance by host immune response. Type I interferon treatments improved clinical outcome of mice (100% vs 0% survival). CONCLUSIONS: Besides virus dissemination, inflammation of various tissues, especially orchitis, may be potential complications of ZIKV infection with significant implications on disease transmission and male fertility.

Singlet oxygen (1O2) and a reaction product of it, excited carbonyls (CO(*)), are important ROS. 1O2 and CO(*) are nonradicalic and emit light (one photon/molecule) when returning to ground state oxygen. Especially activated polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (PMN) produce large amounts of 1O2. Via activation of the respiratory burst (NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase) they synthesize hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chloramines (in particular N-chlorotaurine). Chloramines are selective and stable chemical generators of 1O2. In the human organism, 1O2 is both a signal and a weapon with therapeutic potency against very different pathogens, such as microbes, virus, cancer cells and thrombi. Chloramines at blood concentrations between 1 and 2 mmol/L inactivate lipid enveloped virus and chloramines at blood concentrations below 0.5 mmol/L, i.e. at oxidant concentrations that do not affect thrombocytes or hemostasis factors, act antithrombotically by activation of the physiologic PMN mediated fibrinolysis; this thrombolysis is of selective nature, i.e. it does not impair the hemostasis system of the patient allowing the antithrombotic treatment in patients where the current risky thrombolytic treatment is contraindicated. The action of 1O2 might be compared to the signaling and destroying gunfire of soldiers directed against bandits at night, resulting in an autorecruitment of the physiological inflammatory response.

Although few children had positive rapid influenza assay results and the morbidity of disease in the community appeared to be minimal for the majority of children, anxiety about pandemic influenza drove a large number of ED visits, necessitating an increase in surge capacity. Surge capacity was augmented both through utilization of existing institutional resources and by creating a novel area in which to treat patients with potential airborne pathogens. Infection control procedures and patient safety were also maximized through patient cohorting and adaptation of social distancing measures to the ED setting.

Repressors and activators of the ACE2 and FURIN genes were identified based on the analyses of gene silencing and overexpression experiments as well as relevant transgenic mouse models. Panels of repressors (VDR; GATA5; SFTPC; HIF1a) and activators (HMGA2; INSIG1; RUNX1; HNF4a; JNK1/c-FOS) were then employed to identify existing drugs manifesting in their effects on gene expression signatures of potential coronavirus infection mitigation agents. Using this strategy, vitamin D and quercetin have been identified as putative 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mitigation agents. Quercetin has been identified as one of top-scoring candidate therapeutics in the supercomputer SUMMIT drug-docking screen and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) of expression profiling experiments (EPEs), indicating that highly structurally similar quercetin, luteolin, and eriodictyol could serve as scaffolds for the development of efficient inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In agreement with this notion, quercetin alters the expression of 98 of 332 (30%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, thus potentially interfering with functions of 23 of 27 (85%) of the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in human cells. Similarly, Vitamin D may interfere with functions of 19 of 27 (70%) of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins by altering expression of 84 of 332 (25%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the potential effects of both quercetin and vitamin D, the inference could be made that functions of 25 of 27 (93%) of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells may be altered. GSEA and EPEs identify multiple drugs, smoking, and many disease conditions that appear to act as putative coronavirus infection-promoting agents. Discordant patterns of testosterone versus estradiol impacts on SARS-CoV-2 targets suggest a plausible molecular explanation of the apparently higher male mortality during the coronavirus pandemic. Estradiol, in contrast with testosterone, affects the expression of the majority of human genes (203 of 332; 61%) encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets, thus potentially interfering with functions of 26 of 27 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. A hypothetical tripartite combination consisting of quercetin/vitamin D/estradiol may affect expression of 244 of 332 (73%) human genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets. Of major concern is the ACE2 and FURIN expression in many human cells and tissues, including immune cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may infect a broad range of cellular targets in the human body. Infection of immune cells may cause immunosuppression, long-term persistence of the virus, and spread of the virus to secondary targets. Present analyses and numerous observational studies indicate that age-associated vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the high mortality of older adults and the elderly. Immediate availability for targeted experimental and clinical interrogations of potential COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents, namely vitamin D and quercetin, as well as of the highly selective (Ki, 600 pm) intrinsically specific FURIN inhibitor (a1-antitrypsin Portland (a1-PDX), is considered an encouraging factor. Observations reported in this contribution are intended to facilitate follow-up targeted experimental studies and, if warranted, randomized clinical trials to identify and validate therapeutically viable interventions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, gene expression profiles of vitamin D and quercetin activities and their established safety records as over-the-counter medicinal substances strongly argue that they may represent viable candidates for further considerations of their potential utility as COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents. In line with the results of present analyses, a randomized interventional clinical trial evaluating effects of estradiol on severity of the coronavirus infection in COVID19+ and presumptive COVID19+ patients and two interventional randomized clinical trials evaluating effects of vitamin D on prevention and treatment of COVID-19 were listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.",2020-05-21,"Glinsky, Gennadi V.",Biomedicines,,#327186,,document_parses/pdf_json/a652b715bf1d0fbe2c4a33718fe570a1b1759c9e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7277789.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32455629/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines8050129,218910594

To the cats that developed FIP, ADA (10 mg/animal) was administered twice between day 0 and day 4 after the start of treatment. ICZ (50 mg/head, SID) was orally administered daily from day 0 after the start of treatment. ADA demonstrated dose-dependent neutralizing activity against rfTNF-alpha. In an animal experiment, 2 of 3 cats showed improvements in FIP clinical symptoms and blood chemistry test results, an increase in the peripheral blood lymphocyte count, and a decrease in the plasma alpha 1-AGP level were observed after the beginning of treatment. One of the cats failed to respond to treatment and was euthanized, although the viral gene level in ascites temporarily decreased after the start of treatment. ADA was found to have neutralizing activity against rfTNF-alpha. The combined use of ADA and ICZ showed a therapeutic effect for experimentally induced FIP. We consider these drugs to be a treatment option until effective anti-FIPV drugs become available.",2020-03-31,"Doki, Tomoyoshi; Toda, Masahiro; Hasegawa, Nobuhisa; Hohdatsu, Tsutomu; Takano, Tomomi",Arch Virol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/29a1ea92f2739cd56956bdf4308be444e75f4ba4.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110289.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32236683/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-020-04605-7,214718935

We aim to investigate the prevalence and age pattern of viral co-infection in children hospitalized with lower tract acute respiratory infection (LT-ARI), using molecular techniques. METHODS: A nested polymerase chain reaction approach was used to detect Influenza (A, B), metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza (1–4), rhinovirus, adenovirus (A—F), bocavirus and coronaviruses (NL63, 229E, OC43) in respiratory samples of children with acute respiratory infection prospectively admitted to any of the GENDRES network hospitals between 2011–2013. The results were corroborated in an independent cohort collected in the UK. RESULTS: A total of 204 and 97 nasopharyngeal samples were collected in the GENDRES and UK cohorts, respectively. In both cohorts, RSV was the most frequent pathogen (52.9% and 36.1% of the cohorts, respectively). Co-infection with multiple viruses was found in 92 samples (45.1%) and 29 samples (29.9%), respectively; this was most frequent in the 12–24 months age group. The most frequently observed co-infection patterns were RSV—Rhinovirus (23 patients, 11.3%, GENDRES cohort) and RSV—bocavirus / bocavirus—influenza (5 patients, 5.2%, UK cohort). CONCLUSION: The presence of more than one virus in pediatric patients admitted to hospital with LT-ARI is very frequent and seems to peak at 12–24 months of age.

To understand the effect of transport-related infection on disease spread, an SEIRS (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) epidemic model for two cities is formulated and analyzed. The epidemiological threshold, known as the basic reproduction number, of the model is derived. If the basic reproduction number is below unity, the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. Thus, the disease can be eradicated from the community. There exists an endemic equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable if the reproduction number is larger than unity. This means that the disease will persist within the community. The results show that transportation among regions will change the disease dynamics and break infection out even if infectious diseases will go to extinction in each isolated region without transport-related infection. In addition, the result shows that transport-related infection intensifies the disease spread if infectious diseases break out to cause an endemic situation in each region, in the sense of that both the absolute and relative size of patients increase. Further, the formulated model is applied to the real data of SARS outbreak in 2003 to study the transmission of disease during the movement between two regions. The results show that the transport-related infection is effected to the number of infected individuals and the duration of outbreak in such the way that the disease becomes more endemic due to the movement between two cities.

It is transmitted through droplets, contact, the fecal-oral route, and airborne transmission under certain conditions that allow droplets to combine with air particles to form an aerosol. Viral loads are higher in the nasal area and similar in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Medical situations have been classified into high and low risk of generating aerosols. Most procedures and surgery in otolaryngology correspond to high-risk medical situations. This review aims to gather the vast amount of available information and generate recommendations for different surgical procedures according to aerosolization risk and COVID-19 status, with use of specific personal protective equipment in each case.

REVIEW METHODS: We conducted a review on the literature on personal protective equipment for otolaryngologic surgery and surgical indication restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 is an easily transmitted virus. Asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with COVID-19 present an upper airway high viral load, conferring otolaryngologic procedures a high risk of aerosolization.

Aim To investigate HCWs' contacts during a work day and compare these against working adults from the general population. Methods Prospective survey of contacts through 24 h self-reported diary in three public sector tertiary care hospitals and community-based working adults in Singapore. Participants were HCWs and working adults from the community. Findings In all, 211 HCWs and 1028 working adults reported a total of 4066 and 9206 contacts. HCWs reported more work-related contacts than community-based working adults (median of 13 versus 4), and more contacts that were neither household nor work-related (1 versus 0) but fewer household contacts (2 versus 3). HCWs reported more work-related contacts involving physical contacts, and more new contacts particularly with short duration (≤15 min) compared to community-based working adults. Among different HCW types, doctors reported the highest whereas ward-based nurses reported the lowest total work-related contacts. Around half of ward-based and clinic-based nurses' contacts involved physical touch. Work-related contacts reported by clinic-based nurses, doctors, and assorted HCWs were shorter than in ward-based nurses, with a substantial number effectively occurring with new contacts. Institutional effects significant on univariate analyses were much reduced and non-significant after adjusting for confounding by HCW type. Conclusion HCWs' contacts differ substantially from those of community-based working adults. HCWs may thus be at higher risk of acquiring and spreading contact-transmissible and respiratory infections due to the nature of their work. Whereas total number of contacts was fairly similar between HCW types, the characteristics of their contacts differed substantively.",2018-04-30,"Jiang, Lili; Ng, Isabel Hui Leng; Hou, Yan'an; Li, Dunli; Tan, Linda Wei Lin; Ho, Hanley Jian An; Chen, Mark I-Cheng",Journal of Hospital Infection,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/473c721f42096f1b8450c669b607486841a5f72a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114670.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019567011730587X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2017.10.020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019567011730587X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29097147/,4035624

The 2015 South Korean MERS outbreak presented an opportunity for us to compare tweets responding to the same outbreak in different languages. Methods We obtained a 1% sample through Twitter streaming application programming interface from June 1 to 30, 2015. We identified MERS-related tweets with keywords such as ‘MERS’ and its translation in five different languages. We translated non-English tweets into English for statistical comparison. Results We retrieved MERS-related Twitter data in five languages: Korean (N = 21,823), English (N = 4024), Thai (N = 2084), Japanese (N = 1334) and Indonesian (N = 1256). Categories of randomly selected user profiles (p < 0.001) and the top 30 sources of retweets (p < 0.001) differed between the five language corpora. Among the randomly selected user profiles, K-pop fans ranged from 4% in the Korean corpus to 70% in the Thai corpus; media ranged from 0% (Thai) to 14% (Indonesian); political advocates ranged from 0% (Thai) to 19% (Japanese); medical professionals ranged from 0% (Thai) to 7% (English). Among the top 30 sources of retweets for each corpus (150 in total), 70 (46.7%) were media; 29 (19.3%) were K-pop fans; 7 (4.7%) were political; 9 (6%) were medical; and 35 (23.3%) were categorized as ‘Others’. We performed chi-square feature selection and identified the top 20 keywords that were most unique to each corpus.

Respiratory protection and negative-pressure rooms are needed to prevent transmission of airborne-spread diseases, but US hospitals lack available and/or properly functioning negative-pressure rooms. Creating new rooms or retrofitting existing facilities is time-consuming and expensive. Methods Safe methods of managing patients with airborne-spread diseases and establishing temporary negative-pressure and/or protective environments were determined by a literature review. Relevant data were analyzed and synthesized to generate a response algorithm. Results Ideal patient management and placement guidelines, including instructions for choosing respiratory protection and creating temporary negative-pressure or other protective environments, were delineated. Findings were summarized in a treatment algorithm. Conclusion The threat of bioterrorism and emerging infections increases health care's need for negative-pressure and/or protective environments.

Current asthma management involves a step-up and step-down approach based on asthma control with a large degree of heterogeneity in responses to the main drug classes currently in use: β2-adrenergic receptor agonists, corticosteroids, and leukotriene modifiers. Importantly, asthma is heterogeneous with respect to clinical presentation and the inflammatory mechanisms that underlie it. This heterogeneity likely contributes to variable results in clinical trials, particularly when targeting specific inflammatory mediators. These factors have motivated a drive toward stratified medicine in asthma based on clinical/cellular outcomes or genetics (i.e., pharmacogenetics). Significant progress has been made in identifying genetic polymorphisms that influence the efficacy and potential for adverse effects of all main classes of asthma drugs. Importantly an emerging role for genetics in phase II development of newer therapies has been demonstrated (e.g., anti-IL4). Similarly, the stratification of patients based on clinical characteristics (e.g., blood and sputum eosinophil levels) has been critical in evaluating newer therapies (e.g., anti-IL5). As a proof of concept, anti-IgE is the latest therapy to be introduced into clinical practice, although only for severe, allergic patients (i.e., in a stratified manner). As new asthma genes are identified using genome-wide association, among other technologies, new targets (e.g., IL33/IL33 receptor (IL1RL1)) will emerge and pharmacogenetics in these development programs will be essential. In this chapter we review the current understanding of asthma pathobiology and its clinical presentation, as well as the use of stratified medicine, which holds great promise for maximizing clinical outcomes and minimizing adverse effects in existing and new therapies.",2014-12-31,"Shaw, Dominick; Portelli, Michael; Sayers, Ian",Handbook of Pharmacogenomics and Stratified Medicine,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/844e5563f2255a5701d945729aa2d3962cf665cc.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149851.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123868824000281; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123868824000281,58349961

The coverage rate of influenza vaccination for this age group was suboptimal at 8.5 % in 2012/13. This study investigates the factors associated with the uptake of influenza vaccination among adults in Hong Kong aged 50–64 years. METHODS: A case–control study was conducted in communities by street intercept interviews from 17 July to 15 August 2013. Cases were adults aged 50–64 years who had received the influenza vaccine in 2011/12 or 2012/13, while controls were the same as the cases, except they had not received the influenza vaccine in 2011/12 or 2012/13. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed on the data to explore the associations between vaccination status and the variables. RESULTS: Six hundred and four respondents in total were interviewed and included in the analysis. There were 193 cases (vaccinated) and 411 controls (non-vaccinated), with a case-to-control ratio of 1:2.1. The following were strongly associated with vaccination compared to other factors: ‘eligible for free government vaccine’ (OR6.38, 95 % CI, 3.43-11.87, p < 0.001); ‘willing to receive flu vaccination for free’ (OR4.84, 95 % CI, 2.13-11.03, p < 0.001); ‘perceived having severe or moderate symptoms when contracting flu’ (OR2.90, 95 % CI, 1.21-6.97, p = 0.02), and ‘convenient to reach a vaccination location’ (OR2.87, 95 % CI, 1.06-7.74, p = 0.04). The majority of the cases (80.8 %) and controls (93.9 %) were not aware that they belonged to a recommended group for influenza vaccination and most (>80 %) were willing to be vaccinated if it was free.

As such, it has long been targeted in the treatment of hypertension through the use of ACE inhibitors. Although ACE has been studied since the 1950s, only recently have the full range of functions of this enzyme begun to truly be appreciated. ACE homologues have been found in a host of other organisms, and are now known to be conserved in insects. Insect ACE homologues typically share over 30 % amino acid sequence identity with human ACE. Given that insects lack a mammalian type circulatory system, they must have crucial roles in other physiological processes. The first ACE crystal structures were reported during the last decade and have enabled these enzymes to be studied from an entirely different perspective. Here we review many of these key developments and the implications that they have had on our understanding of the diverse functions of these enzymes. Specifically, we consider how structural information is being used in the design of a new generation of ACE inhibitors with increased specificity, and how the structures of ACE homologues are related to their functions. The Anopheles gambiae genome is predicted to code for ten ACE homologues, more than any genome studied so far.

While the virus is well-known for its trademark effects on respiratory function, neurological damage has been reported to affect a considerable proportion of severe cases. To characterize the neuro-invasive potential of this disease, a contemporary review of COVID-19 and its neurological sequelae was conducted using the limited, but growing, literature that is available. These neurological squeal are based on the manifestations that the virus has on normal central and peripheral nervous system function. The authors present the virology of the SARS-CoV-2 agent by analyzing its classification as an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus. A comprehensive timeline is then presented, indicating the progression of the disease as a public health threat. Furthermore, underlying chronic neurological conditions potentially lead to more adverse cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 may reach ACE2 receptors on neuronal tissue through mode of the general circulation. The CNS may also be susceptible to an immune response where a “cytokine storm” can manifest into neural injury. Histological evidence is provided, while symptoms such as headache and vertigo are highlighted as CNS manifestations of COVID-19. Treatment of these symptoms is addressed with paracetamol being recommended as a possible, but not conclusive, treatment to some CNS symptoms. The authors then discuss the peripheral nervous system sequelae and COVID's impact on causing chemosensory dysfunction starting with viral attack on olfactory sensory neurons and cells types within the lining of the nose. Histological evidence is also provided while symptoms such as anosmia and ageusia are characterized as PNS manifestations. Possible treatment options for these symptoms are then addressed as a major limitation, as anecdotal, and not conclusive evidence can be made. Finally, preventive measures of the neurological sequelae are addressed using a multidirectional approach. Postmortem examinations of the brains of COVID-19 patients are suggested as being a possible key to formulating new understandings of its neuropathology.

During the early stages of the HP-PRRSV infection, high levels of proinflammatory cytokines are noted in the host peripheral blood, which are accompanied by severe lesions in the lungs and immune system organs; these are considered as the greatest contributors to the overall disease burden. We hypothesized that the anti-PRRSV response in piglets might be mediated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which led to a decrease in the psycho-neuroendocrinological manifestation of HP-PRRSV etiology via immune response regulation. RESULTS: We investigated the regulation of the HPA axis in HP-PRRSV-infected piglets that were treated with 1 mg/kg body weight (b. w.)/day mifepristone (RU486) or 2 mg/kg b.w./day dexamethasone (DEX). Both RU486 and DEX enhanced the disease status of the piglets infected by the HP-PRRSV HuN4 strain, resulting in high mortality and more severe pathological changes in the lungs. CONCLUSIONS: HP-PRRSV infection activates the HPA axis, and artificial regulation of the immune-endocrine system enhances disease severity in HP-PRRSV-infected piglets. Thus, DEX and RU486 should be avoided in the clinical treatment of HP-PRRS.

On the basis of biochemical evidence, it is often presumed that such NO• -dependent oxidations are due to the formation of the oxidant peroxynitrite, although alternative mechanisms involving the phagocyte-derived heme proteins myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase might be operative during conditions of inflammation. Because of the overwhelming literature on NO• generation and activities in the respiratory tract, it would be beyond the scope of this commentary to review this area comprehensively.

DESIGN: Multicentre, open label, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 16 government designated covid-19 treatment centres in China, 11 to 29 February 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 150 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed covid-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis (75 patients assigned to hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care, 75 to standard of care alone). INTERVENTIONS: Hydroxychloroquine administrated at a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily (total treatment duration: two or three weeks for patients with mild to moderate or severe disease, respectively). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Negative conversion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by 28 days, analysed according to the intention to treat principle. Adverse events were analysed in the safety population in which hydroxychloroquine recipients were participants who received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine non-recipients were those managed with standard of care alone. RESULTS: Of 150 patients, 148 had mild to moderate disease and two had severe disease. The mean duration from symptom onset to randomisation was 16.6 (SD 10.5; range 3-41) days. A total of 109 (73%) patients (56 standard of care; 53 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) had negative conversion well before 28 days, and the remaining 41 (27%) patients (19 standard of care; 22 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) were censored as they did not reach negative conversion of virus. The probability of negative conversion by 28 days in the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group was 85.4% (95% confidence interval 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that in the standard of care group (81.3%, 71.2% to 89.6%). The difference between groups was 4.1% (95% confidence interval –10.3% to 18.5%). In the safety population, adverse events were recorded in 7/80 (9%) hydroxychloroquine non-recipients and in 21/70 (30%) hydroxychloroquine recipients. The most common adverse event in the hydroxychloroquine recipients was diarrhoea, reported in 7/70 (10%) patients. Two hydroxychloroquine recipients reported serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of hydroxychloroquine did not result in a significantly higher probability of negative conversion than standard of care alone in patients admitted to hospital with mainly persistent mild to moderate covid-19. Adverse events were higher in hydroxychloroquine recipients than in non-recipients.

Turbidity was measured on combinations of virus and each sediment type at low concentration to determine aggregation rates. Aggregation of sediment with virus occurred regardless of mineral type, and larger fraction of virus is expected to aggregate with increasing sediment concentration leading to higher deposition rates. The negatively charged sediments, aggregated with φ6 (also negatively charged at neutral pH) at a faster rate than the positively charged sediments, yielding turbidity slopes of 4.94 × 10(−3) s(−1) and 7.50 × 10(−4) s(−1) for φ6-montmorillonite and φ6-illite aggregates, respectively, and 2.98 × 10(−5) s(−1) and 2.84 × 10(−5) s(−1), for φ6-goethite and φ6-kaolinite, respectively. This indicates that the interaction between sediments and virus is hydrophobic, rather than electrostatic. Large numbers of virions remained viable post-aggregation, despite the fragility of the viral envelope, indicating that small-sized aggregates, which may travel more readily through porous media, may pose an infection risk. The fraction of φ6 that remained viable varied with sediment type, with montmorillonite-φ6 aggregates experiencing the greatest reduction in infectivity at 35%.

NAFLD is tightly associated with the most frequent metabolic disorders, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Both multisystem diseases share several common mechanisms. Alterations of tissue communications include excessive lipid and later cytokine release by dysfunctional adipose tissue, intestinal dysbiosis and ectopic fat deposition in skeletal muscle. On the hepatocellular level, this leads to insulin resistance due to abnormal lipid handling and mitochondrial function. Over time, cellular oxidative stress and activation of inflammatory pathways, again supported by multiorgan crosstalk, determine NAFLD progression. Recent studies show that particularly the severe insulin resistant diabetes (SIRD) subgroup (cluster) associates with NAFLD and its accelerated progression and increases the risk of diabetes-related cardiovascular and kidney diseases, underpinning the critical role of insulin resistance. Consequently, lifestyle modification and certain drug classes used to treat T2DM have demonstrated effectiveness for treating NAFLD, but also some novel therapeutic concepts may be beneficial for both NAFLD and T2DM. This review addresses the bidirectional relationship between mechanisms underlying T2DM and NAFLD, the relevance of novel biomarkers for improving the diagnostic modalities and the identification of subgroups at specific risk of disease progression. Also, the role of metabolism-related drugs in NAFLD is discussed in light of the recent clinical trials.

In addition, it has to cross the mucus barrier before it infects mucosa cells. We show that Ad41 infectivity is not diminished by acid exposure, a condition limiting the infectivity of the respiratory Ad. This feature can be attributed to a large extent to the global basic charge of enteric Ad virions and to the stability of Ad41 fiber, a viral protein mediating virus attachment. Upon exposure to pH shock, the respiratory Ad2 loses its ability to interact with lipids while enteric Ad41 still binds to the major phospholipids of gastric and intestine mucus.

Evidence suggests that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) ameliorates inflammation in animal models of renal disease, implying that HGF might inhibit specific components of the inflammatory response. This study examined the effect of HGF on endothelial E-selectin expression in acute inflammation induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. In vitro, HGF suppressed TNF-α-induced cell surface expression of E-selectin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and inhibited E-selectin mediated monocytic adhesion to endothelial monolayers. HGF activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt that in turn inhibited its downstream transducer glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3. Blockade of the PI3K–Akt pathway with specific inhibitors abrogated HGF induced inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 and suppression of E-selectin. In addition, selective inhibition of GSK3 activity by lithium suppressed TNF-α-induced E-selectin expression and monocytic adhesion, reminiscent of the action of HGF. Moreover, ectopic expression of an uninhibitable mutant GSK3β, in which the regulatory serine-9 is replaced by alanine, abolished HGF's suppressive effect on endothelial E-selectin. In vivo, administration of exogenous HGF reduced endothelial expression of E-selectin induced by bolus injection of TNF-α. This was associated with less sequestration of circulating fluorescence-labeled macrophages in the kidney.

Ebolavirus (EBOV) causes a severe, frequently fatal hemorrhagic syndrome in humans. Each outbreak of the Ebolavirus over the last three decades has perpetuated fear and economic turmoil among the local and regional populations in Africa. Until now it has been considered a tragic malady confined largely to the isolated regions of the African continent, but it is no longer so. The frequency of outbreaks has increased since the 1970s. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in Western Africa has been the most severe in history and was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization. Given the widespread use of modern transportation and global travel, the EBOV is now a risk to the entire Global Village, with intercontinental transmission only an airplane flight away. Clinically, symptoms typically appear after an incubation period of approximately 11 days. A flu-like syndrome can progress to full hemorrhagic fever with multiorgan failure, and frequently, death. Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of viral antigens or Ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the blood or other body fluids. Although historically the mortality of this infection exceeded 80%, modern medicine and public health measures have been able to lower this figure and reduce the impact of EBOV on individuals and communities. The treatment involves early, aggressive supportive care with rehydration. Core interventions, including contact tracing, preventive initiatives, active surveillance, effective isolation and quarantine procedures, and timely response to patients, are essential for a successful outbreak control. These measures, combined with public health education, point-of-care diagnostics, promising new vaccine and pharmaceutical efforts, and coordinated efforts of the international community, give new hope to the Global effort to eliminate Ebola as a public health threat.

The aim of this study was to produce recombinant N protein of IBV in the baculovirus system to use in ELISA diagnostic tests in order to enable the assessment of the sero-prevalence and risk of IBV infections in chickens in Turkey. For this, the gene encoding the N protein of the Beaudette strain of IBV was expressed using a recombinant baculovirus expression system. The recombinant N protein was purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. An estimated 50-kDa recombinant protein corresponding to the expected molecular weight of IBV N including the 6xHis tag was detected using an anti-His monoclonal antibody. Specific immunoreactivity of the recombinant protein was confirmed by Western blot using antiserum obtained from vaccinated and naturally infected chicken from Turkey as well as using a monoclonal antibody raised against the N protein of the IBV Massachusetts strain. The results obtained with the in-house ELISA had high agreement with a commercial ELISA. Immunoreactivity analysis using antisera in Western blotting and the in-house ELISA suggests that the recombinant IBV N protein could be broadly cross-reactive with antisera produced against different IBV strains.

Mannose is one of the fundamental building blocks of glycans in many biological membranes. Moreover, oligomannoses are commonly found on the surface of pathogens such as bacteria and viruses as both glycolipids and glycoproteins. However, their mechanism of action is not well understood, even though this is of great potential interest for translational medicine. Sequence-defined amphiphilic Janus glycodendrimers containing simple mono- and disaccharides that mimic glycolipids are known to self-assemble into glycodendrimersomes, which in turn resemble the surface of a cell by encoding carbohydrate activity via supramolecular multivalency. The synthetic challenge of preparing Janus glycodendrimers containing more complex linear and branched glycans has so far prevented access to more realistic cell mimics. However, the present work reports the use of an isothiocyanate-amine “click”-like reaction between isothiocyanate-containing sequence-defined amphiphilic Janus dendrimers and either linear or branched oligosaccharides containing up to six monosaccharide units attached to a hydrophobic amino-pentyl linker, a construct not expected to assemble into glycodendrimersomes. Unexpectedly, these oligoMan-containing dendrimers, which have their hydrophobic linker connected via a thiourea group to the amphiphilic part of Janus glycodendrimers, self-organize into nanoscale glycodendrimersomes. Specifically, the mannose-binding lectins that best agglutinate glycodendrimersomes are those displaying hexamannose. Lamellar “raft-like” nanomorphologies on the surface of glycodendrimersomes, self-organized from these sequence-defined glycans, endow these membrane mimics with high biological activity.",2020-06-02,"Xiao, Qi; Delbianco, Martina; Sherman, Samuel E.; Reveron Perez, Aracelee M.; Bharate, Priya; Pardo-Vargas, Alonso; Rodriguez-Emmenegger, Cesar; Kostina, Nina Yu; Rahimi, Khosrow; Söder, Dominik; Möller, Martin; Klein, Michael L.; Seeberger, Peter H.; Percec, Virgil",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/9a168e4aa554a6f77c6f34794ae9b17dac2d003f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d3649bdb0e738098efb5bc9b5a4194858fdbd4a2.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7275670.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32424105/; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2003938117,218688759

Given that many basic regulatory mechanisms were first discovered in viral systems, the current study endeavored to: (i) identify −1 PRF signals in genomic databases, (ii) apply the protocol to the yeast genome and (iii) test selected candidates at the bench. Computational analyses revealed the presence of 10 340 consensus −1 PRF signals in the yeast genome. Of the 6353 yeast ORFs, 1275 contain at least one strong and statistically significant −1 PRF signal. Eight out of nine selected sequences promoted efficient levels of PRF in vivo. These findings provide a robust platform for high throughput computational and laboratory studies and demonstrate that functional −1 PRF signals are widespread in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The data generated by this study have been deposited into a publicly available database called the PRFdb. The presence of stable mRNA pseudoknot structures in these −1 PRF signals, and the observation that the predicted outcomes of nearly all of these genomic frameshift signals would direct ribosomes to premature termination codons, suggest two possible mRNA destabilization pathways through which −1 PRF signals could post-transcriptionally regulate mRNA abundance.",2006-12-07,"Jacobs, Jonathan L.; Belew, Ashton T.; Rakauskaite, Rasa; Dinman, Jonathan D.",Nucleic Acids Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2606e22c2560b4cc0909c102ee356d562d78a9f3.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1802563.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17158156/,14293755

METHODS: We retrospectively collected chest CT exams including n = 498 on 151 unique patients RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 and n = 497 unique patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Both COVID-19 and CAP image sets were partitioned into three groups for training, validation, and testing respectively. In an attempt to discriminate COVID-19 from CAP, we developed several classifiers based on three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We also asked two experienced radiologists to visually interpret the testing set and discriminate COVID-19 from CAP. The classification performance of the computer algorithms and the radiologists was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the nonparametric approaches with multiplicity adjustments when necessary. RESULTS: One of the considered models showed non-trivial, but moderate diagnostic ability overall (AUC of 0.70 with 99% CI 0.56–0.85). This model allowed for the identification of 8–50% of CAP patients with only 2% of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Professional or automated interpretation of CT exams has a moderately low ability to distinguish between COVID-19 and CAP cases. However, the automated image analysis is promising for targeted decision-making due to being able to accurately identify a sizable subsect of non-COVID-19 cases. KEY POINTS: • Both human experts and artificial intelligent models were used to classify the CT scans. • ROC analysis and the nonparametric approaches were used to analyze the performance of the radiologists and computer algorithms. • Unique image features or patterns may not exist for reliably distinguishing all COVID-19 from CAP; however, there may be imaging markers that can identify a sizable subset of non-COVID-19 cases.",2020-05-28,"Pu, Jiantao; Leader, Joseph; Bandos, Andriy; Shi, Junli; Du, Pang; Yu, Juezhao; Yang, Bohan; Ke, Shi; Guo, Youmin; Field, Jessica B.; Fuhrman, Carl; Wilson, David; Sciurba, Frank; Jin, Chenwang",Eur Radiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/65954dcce2c297b5a195b24e2f6cf6e13087c3ed.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7253230.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32462445/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-06956-w,218913257

However, there is still no effective therapeutic treatment for NAFLD. Here, we showed that remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734), as a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug with anti-inflammatory effects, was effective for attenuating HFD-induced metabolic disorder and insulin resistance. Results revealed that the liver weight, hepatic dysfunction and lipid accumulation were markedly increased compared with that of the Control group, while that of the RDV group exhibited significant reduction, accompanied by the improved signaling pathway regulating fatty acid metabolism. In agreement with reduced lipid deposition, RDV supplementation suppressed the systematic and hepatic inflammation, as evidenced by reduction of inflammatory cytokines and the blockage of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. In addition, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and its down-streaming factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) were greatly increased in livers of HFD-fed mice, which were considerably restrained by RDV treatment. The in vitro analysis suggested that RDV functioned as an inhibitor of STING, contributing to the suppression of dyslipidemia and inflammation induced by palmitate (PA). However, PA-triggered lipid deposition and inflammatory response was further accelerated in hepatocytes with STING over-expression. Notably, RDV-attenuated lipid disorder and inflammation were significantly abrogated by the over-expression of STING in PA-stimulated hepatocytes.

Some of the H5N1 and H9N2 virus subtypes induce markedly elevated cytokine levels when compared with the seasonal H1N1 virus. We previously showed that H5N1/97 hyperinduces tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha through p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). However, the detailed mechanisms of p38MAPK activation and TNF-alpha hyperinduction following influenza virus infections are not known. Negative feedback regulations of cytokine expression play important roles in avoiding overwhelming production of proinflammatory cytokines. Here we hypothesize that protein phosphatases are involved in the regulation of cytokine expressions during influenza virus infection. We investigated the roles of protein phosphatases including MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) and protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) in modulating p38MAPK activation and downstream TNF-alpha expressions in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (PBMac) infected with H9N2/G1 or H1N1 influenza virus. We demonstrate that H9N2/G1 virus activated p38MAPK and hyperinduced TNF-alpha production in PBMac when compared with H1N1 virus. H9N2/G1 induced PP2A activity in PBMac and, with the treatment of a PP2A inhibitor, p38MAPK phosphorylation and TNF-alpha production were further increased in the virus-infected macrophages. However, H9N2/G1 did not induce the expression of PP2A indicating that the activation of PP2A is not mediated by p38MAPK in virus-infected PBMac. On the other hand, PP2A may not be the targets of H9N2/G1 in the upstream of p38MAPK signaling pathways since H1N1 also induced PP2A activation in primary macrophages.

The aim of this study was to examine perceptions and behaviours of the general public during the early phase of the Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in the Netherlands. METHODS: Two cross-sectional and one follow-up online survey (survey 1, 30 April-4 May; survey 2, 15-19 June; survey 3, 11-20 August 2009). Adults aged 18 years and above participating in a representative Internet panel were invited (survey 1, n = 456; survey 2, n = 478; follow-up survey 3, n = 934). Main outcome measures were 1) time trends in risk perception, feelings of anxiety, and behavioural responses (survey 1-3) and 2) factors associated with taking preventive measures and strong intention to comply with government-advised preventive measures in the future (survey 3). RESULTS: Between May and August 2009, the level of knowledge regarding Influenza A (H1N1) increased, while perceived severity of the new flu, perceived self-efficacy, and intention to comply with preventive measures decreased. The perceived reliability of information from the government decreased from May to August (62% versus 45%). Feelings of anxiety decreased from May to June, and remained stable afterwards. From June to August 2009, perceived vulnerability increased and more respondents took preventive measures (14% versus 38%). Taking preventive measures was associated with no children in the household, high anxiety, high self-efficacy, more agreement with statements on avoidance, and paying much attention to media information regarding Influenza A (H1N1). Having a strong intention to comply with government-advised preventive measures in the future was associated with higher age, high perceived severity, high anxiety, high perceived efficacy of measures, high self-efficacy, and finding governmental information to be reliable. CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing trends over time in perceived severity and anxiety are consistent with the reality: the clinical picture of influenza turned out to be mild in course of time.

An international spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has attracted global attention. ZIKV is conveyed by a mosquito vector, Aedes species, which also acts as the vector species of dengue and chikungunya viruses. Methods. Arrival time of ZIKV importation (i.e., the time at which the first imported case was diagnosed) in each imported country was collected from publicly available data sources. Employing a survival analysis model in which the hazard is an inverse function of the effective distance as informed by the airline transportation network data, and using dengue and chikungunya virus transmission data, risks of importation and local transmission were estimated. Results. A total of 78 countries with imported case(s) have been identified, with the arrival time ranging from 1 to 44 weeks since the first ZIKV was identified in Brazil, 2015. Whereas the risk of importation was well explained by the airline transportation network data, the risk of local transmission appeared to be best captured by additionally accounting for the presence of dengue and chikungunya viruses. Discussion. The risk of importation may be high given continued global travel of mildly infected travelers but, considering that the public health concerns over ZIKV infection stems from microcephaly, it is more important to focus on the risk of local and widespread transmission that could involve pregnant women.

Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated viral fusion proteins, encoding around 69-87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Using a multifaceted structural approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs.

However, the costly commercial Ulp1 and its complicated procedures limit its application in the preparation of the target protein with natural N-terminal sequence. Here, we describe the preparation of bioactive codon-optimized recombinant truncated Ulp1 (Leu403-Lys621) (rtUlp1) of S. cerevisiae in Escherichia coli using only one-step with Ni–NTA affinity chromatograph, and the application of rtUlp1 to cleave the SUMO fusion protein by simply mixing the purified rtUlp1, SUMO fusion protein and DL-Dithiothreitol in Tris–HCl buffer. The optimal expression level of non-fusion protein rtUlp1 accounts for approximately 50 % of the total cellular protein and 36 % of the soluble form by addition of isopropyl β-D-l-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.4 mM at 18 °C for 20 h. The purification of target protein rtUlp1 was conducted by Ni–NTA affinity chromatography. The final yield of rtUlp1 was 45 mg/l in flask fermentation with a purity up to 95 %. Furthermore, the high purity of rtUlp1 could effectively cleave the SUMO-tTβRII fusion protein (SUMO gene fused to truncated transforming growth factor-beta receptor type II gene) with the above simplified approach, and the specific activity of the rtUlp1 reached up to 2.8 × 10(4) U/mg, which is comparable to the commercial Ulp1. The preparation and application strategy of the rtUlp1 with commonly available laboratory resources in this study will be convenient to the cleavage of the SUMO fusion protein to obtain the natural N-terminal target protein, which can be implemented in difficult-to-express protein functional analysis.",2016-03-10,"Wang, Xiaohua; Liu, Haifeng; Liu, Yawei; Li, Yuting; Yan, Lei; Yuan, Xiaohuan; Zhang, Yufei; Wu, Yan; Liu, Jieting; Zhang, Chunlei; Chu, Yanhui",Protein J,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/dc1cdee079fdcb1a95202db6cad74a9dda253d0c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088175.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26960810/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10930-016-9654-1,33399142

The pandemic has the potential to differentially disadvantage chronically ill patients, including those with Parkinson's disease (PD). The first health care reaction has been to limit access to clinics and neurology wards to preserve fragile patients with PD from being infected. In some regions, the shortage of medical staff has also forced movement disorders neurologists to provide care for patients with COVID-19. Objective To share the experience of various movement disorder neurologists operating in different world regions and provide a common approach to patients with PD, with a focus on those already on advanced therapies, which may serve as guidance in the current pandemic and for emergency situations that we may face in the future. Conclusion Most of us were unprepared to deal with this condition given that in many health care systems, telemedicine has been only marginally available or only limited to email or telephone contacts. In addition, to ensure sufficient access to intensive care unit beds, most elective procedures (including deep brain stimulation or the initiation of infusion therapies) have been postponed. We all hope there will soon be a time when we will return to more regular hospital schedules. However, we should consider this crisis as an opportunity to change our approach and encourage our hospitals and health care systems to facilitate the remote management of chronic neurological patients, including those with advanced PD.",2020-05-01,"Fasano, Alfonso; Antonini, Angelo; Katzenschlager, Regina; Krack, Paul; Odin, Per; Evans, Andrew H; Foltynie, Thomas; Volkmann, Jens; Merello, Marcelo",Movement disorders clinical practice,,#259913,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/mdc3.12965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32373652/,218522001

A qualitative interview study in Flemish GPs,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039674,PMC7306272,32554730,cc-by-nc,"OBJECTIVES: The current COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the measures taken to control it, have a profound impact on healthcare. This study was set up to gain insights into the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on the core competencies of general practice, as they are experienced by general practitioners (GPs) on the frontline. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: We performed a descriptive study using semistructured interviews with 132 GPs in Flanders, using a topic list based on the WONCA definition of core competencies in general practice. Data were analysed qualitatively using framework analysis. RESULTS: Changes in practice management and in consultation strategies were quickly adopted. There was a major switch towards telephone triage and consults, for covid-related as well as for non-covid related problems. Patient-centred care is still a major objective. Clinical decision-making is largely focused on respiratory assessment and triage, and GPs feel that acute care is compromised, both by their own changed focus and by the fact that patients consult less frequently for non-covid problems. Chronic care is mostly postponed, and this will have consequences that will extend and become visible after the corona crisis. Through the holistic eyes of primary care, the current outbreak—as well as the measures taken to control it—will have a profound impact on psychological and socioeconomic well-being. This impact is already visible in vulnerable people and will continue to become clear in the medium and long terms. GPs think that they are at high risk of getting infected. Dropping out and being unable to contribute their part or becoming virus transmitters are reported to be greater concerns than getting ill themselves. CONCLUSIONS: The current times have a profound impact on the core competences of primary care. Although the vast increase in patients soliciting medical help and the necessary separate covid and non-covid flows have been dealt with, GPs are worried about the continuity of regular care and the consequences of the anticovid measures. These may become a threat for the general health of the population and for the provision of primary healthcare in the near and distant future.",2020-06-17,"Verhoeven, Veronique; Tsakitzidis, Giannoula; Philips, Hilde; Van Royen, Paul",BMJ Open,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b4466c4bfc22fad10131dc138563ddf36712ca4f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1b79f590e3c657611deba8d2512b682a17f0ac2a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7306272.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039674; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32554730/,219926577

The new and fast dynamics of the pandemic are challenging the health systems of different countries. In the absence of vaccines or effective treatments, mitigation policies, such as social isolation and lock-down of cities, have been adopted, but the results vary among different countries. Some countries were able to control the disease at the moment, as is the case of South Korea. Others, like Italy, are now experiencing the peak of the pandemic. Finally, countries with emerging economies and social issues, like Brazil, are in the initial phase of the pandemic. In this work, we use mathematical models with time-dependent coefficients, techniques of inverse and forward uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis to characterize essential aspects of the COVID-19 in the three countries mentioned above. The model parameters estimated for South Korea revealed effective social distancing and isolation policies, border control, and a high number in the percentage of reported cases. In contrast, underreporting of cases was estimated to be very high in Brazil and Italy. In addition, the model estimated a poor isolation policy at the moment in Brazil, with a reduction of contact around 40%, whereas Italy and South Korea estimated numbers for contact reduction are at 75% and 90%, respectively. This characterization of the COVID-19, in these different countries under different scenarios and phases of the pandemic, supports the importance of mitigation policies, such as social distancing. In addition, it raises serious concerns for socially and economically fragile countries, where underreporting poses additional challenges to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic by significantly increasing the uncertainties regarding its dynamics.",2020-05-14,"Reis, Ruy Freitas; de Melo Quintela, Bárbara; de Oliveira Campos, Joventino; Gomes, Johnny Moreira; Rocha, Bernardo Martins; Lobosco, Marcelo; dos Santos, Rodrigo Weber",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/59fde3475d248b9d801bb8bff06dcfd90ef93510.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7221372.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920302885; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920302885?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412556/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109888,218616453

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is associated with severe morbidity. Although RSV RNA has been detected in serum from patients with RSV lower respiratory disease (LRD) after HCT, the association with clinical outcomes has not been well established in multivariable models. Additionally, the role of antiviral treatment in HCT recipients has not been previously analyzed in multivariable models. Methods. We retrospectively identified HCT recipients with virologically confirmed RSV LRD and tested stored plasma/serum samples by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for RSV RNA. Risk factors for RSV RNA detection and the impact of RSV RNA in serum and antiviral therapy on outcomes were analyzed using multivariable Cox models. Results. RSV RNA was detected in plasma or serum from 28 of 92 (30%) patients at a median of 24.5 days following HCT and 2 days following LRD. In multivariable models, neutropenia, monocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mechanical ventilation increased the risk of plasma/serum RSV RNA detection; lymphopenia and steroid use did not. RSV RNA detection increased the risk of overall mortality in multivariable models (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.09 [P = .02]), whereas treatment with aerosolized ribavirin decreased the risk of overall mortality and pulmonary death (aHR, 0.33 [P = .001] and aHR 0.31 [P = .003], respectively). Conclusions. RSV RNA detection in plasma or serum may be a marker for lung injury and poor outcomes in HCT recipients with RSV LRD.

METHODS: The most efficient pool size was determined to be five specimens using a web-based application. From this analysis, 25 experimental pools were created using 50 µL from one SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal specimen mixed with 4 negative patient specimens (50 µL each) for a total volume of 250 µL. Viral RNA was subsequently extracted from each pool and tested using the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Positive pools were consequently split into individual specimens and tested by extraction and PCR. This method was also tested on an unselected group of 60 nasopharyngeal specimens grouped into 12 pools. RESULTS: All 25 pools were positive with cycle threshold (Ct) values within 0 and 5.03 Ct of the original individual specimens. The analysis of 60 specimens determined that 2 pools were positive followed by identification of 2 individual specimens among the 60 tested. This testing was accomplished while using 22 extractions/PCR tests, a savings of 38 reactions.

METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, SinoMed, CNKI, VIP, China Important Conference Papers Database, China Dissertation Database, and online clinical trial registry websites for published and unpublished randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of CPMs for the common cold till 31 March 2013. Revman 5.2 software was used for data analysis with effect estimate presented as relative risk (RR) and mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of five RCTs were identified. All of the RCTs were of high risk of bias with flawed study design and poor methodological quality.

Bangladesh has confirmed COVID-19 cases and hosts almost 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, with 600,000 concentrated in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site (mean age, 21 years; standard deviation [SD], 18 years; 52% female). Projections of the potential COVID-19 burden, epidemic speed, and healthcare needs in such settings are critical for preparedness planning. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To explore the potential impact of the introduction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, we used a stochastic Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) transmission model with parameters derived from emerging literature and age as the primary determinant of infection severity. We considered three scenarios with different assumptions about the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2. From the simulated infections, we estimated hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected, age-adjusted for the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site age distribution. Our findings suggest that a large-scale outbreak is likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp, with 61%–92% of simulations leading to at least 1,000 people infected across scenarios. On average, in the first 30 days of the outbreak, we expect 18 (95% prediction interval [PI], 2–65), 54 (95% PI, 3–223), and 370 (95% PI, 4–1,850) people infected in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively. These reach 421,500 (95% PI, 376,300–463,500), 546,800 (95% PI, 499,300–567,000), and 589,800 (95% PI, 578,800–595,600) people infected in 12 months, respectively. Hospitalization needs exceeded the existing hospitalization capacity of 340 beds after 55–136 days, between the low and high transmission scenarios. We estimate 2,040 (95% PI, 1,660–2,500), 2,650 (95% PI, 2,030–3,380), and 2,880 (95% PI, 2,090–3,830) deaths in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively. Due to limited data at the time of analyses, we assumed that age was the primary determinant of infection severity and hospitalization. We expect that comorbidities, limited hospitalization, and intensive care capacity may increase this risk; thus, we may be underestimating the potential burden. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a COVID-19 epidemic in a refugee settlement may have profound consequences, requiring large increases in healthcare capacity and infrastructure that may exceed what is currently feasible in these settings. Detailed and realistic planning for the worst case in Kutupalong-Balukhali and all refugee camps worldwide must begin now.

Sixty (36.5%) definite diagnoses (positive blood culture, viral culture, or serological test) and seven (4.2%) probable diagnoses (positive sputum culture) were obtained. An early diagnosis (within 72 h) was possible in 38 (23%) and a late diagnosis in 29 (17.6%) participants. A nasopharyngeal swab contributed in 60.5% of the cases to an early diagnosis. Viral culture identified half (22/43) of the lower respiratory tract infections caused by influenza but only one of six lower respiratory tract infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus. In conclusion, a history of flu-like illness in family members and a total leucocyte count within normal limits makes a viral cause more likely in elderly people hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection during winter.

By moving a critical cis-acting replication element (CRE) from the polyprotein coding region to the 3′ non-coding region we have further developed a cell-based assay (the 3′CRE-REP assay) to yield recombinants throughout the non-structural coding region of poliovirus from dually transfected cells. We have additionally developed a defined biochemical assay in which the only protein present is the poliovirus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which recapitulates the strand transfer events of the recombination process. We have used both assays to investigate the role of the polymerase fidelity and nucleotide turnover rates in recombination. Our results, of both poliovirus intertypic and intratypic recombination in the CRE-REP assay and using a range of polymerase variants in the biochemical assay, demonstrate that RdRp fidelity is a fundamental determinant of recombination frequency. High fidelity polymerases exhibit reduced recombination and low fidelity polymerases exhibit increased recombination in both assays.

New treatment modalities and forms of immunosuppression following transplantation have improved survival from the underlying disease but can lead to prolonged immunosuppression and increased risk of infection.

In addition to neutropenia, long-term defects in cell-mediated immunity are exposing patients to risk of chronic, viral, protozoal and fungal infection. Advances in diagnostic techniques have the potential to improve management and limit unnecessary empirical treatment, allowing a move towards a diagnosis-driven strategy.

fambtykj,,Medline; PMC,Racial and Ethnic Digital Divides in Posting COVID-19 Content on Social Media Among US Adults: Secondary Survey Analysis,10.2196/20472,PMC7340161,32568726,cc-by,"BACKGROUND: Public health surveillance experts are leveraging user-generated content on social media to track the spread and effects of COVID-19. However, racial and ethnic digital divides, which are disparities among people who have internet access and post on social media, can bias inferences. This bias is particularly problematic in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic because due to structural inequalities, members of racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately vulnerable to contracting the virus and to the deleterious economic and social effects from mitigation efforts. Further, important demographic intersections with race and ethnicity, such as gender and age, are rarely investigated in work characterizing social media users; however, they reflect additional axes of inequality shaping differential exposure to COVID-19 and its effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to characterize how the race and ethnicity of US adults are associated with their odds of posting COVID-19 content on social media and how gender and age modify these odds. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center from March 19 to 24, 2020, using a national probability sample (N=10,510). Respondents were recruited from an online panel, where panelists without an internet-enabled device were given one to keep at no cost. The binary dependent variable was responses to an item asking whether respondents “used social media to share or post information about the coronavirus.” We used survey-weighted logistic regressions to estimate the odds of responding in the affirmative based on the race and ethnicity of respondents (white, black, Latino, other race/ethnicity), adjusted for covariates measuring sociodemographic background and COVID-19 experiences. We examined how gender (female, male) and age (18 to 30 years, 31 to 50 years, 51 to 64 years, and 65 years and older) intersected with race and ethnicity by estimating interactions. RESULTS: Respondents who identified as black (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.64; P=.03), Latino (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.36-2.04; P<.001), or other races/ethnicities (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.02-1.72; P=.03) had higher odds than respondents who identified as white of reporting that they posted COVID-19 content on social media. Women had higher odds of posting than men regardless of race and ethnicity (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.39-1.80; P<.001). Among men, respondents who identified as black, Latino, or members of other races/ethnicities were significantly more likely to post than respondents who identified as white. Older adults (65 years or older) had significantly lower odds (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57-0.94; P=.01) of posting compared to younger adults (18-29 years), particularly among those identifying as other races/ethnicities. Latino respondents were the most likely to report posting across all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, members of racial and ethnic minority groups are most likely to contribute to COVID-19 content on social media, particularly among groups traditionally less likely to use social media (older adults and men). The next step is to ensure that data collection procedures capture this diversity by encompassing a breadth of search criteria and social media platforms.",2020-07-03,"Campos-Castillo, Celeste; Laestadius, Linnea I",J Med Internet Res,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7340161.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32568726/; https://doi.org/10.2196/20472,219986892

There is a gap of knowledge conerning the epidemiology of zoonotic diseases at the human-animal interface in different localities in Egypt. Some zoonotic agents are “exotic” for Egypt (e.g., MERS-CoV and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus), others are endemic (e.g., Brucellosis, Schistosomiasis and Avian influenza). Transboundary transmission of emerging pathogens from and to Egypt occurred via different routes, mainly importation/exportation of apparently healthy animals or migratory birds. Control of the infectious agents and multidrug resistant bacteria in the veterinary sector is on the frontline for infection control in humans. The implementation of control programs significantly decreased the prevalence of some zoonoses, such as schistosomiasis and fascioliasis, in some localities within the country. Sustainable awareness, education and training targeting groups at high risk (veterinarians, farmers, abattoir workers, nurses, etc.) are important to lessen the burden of zoonotic diseases among Egyptians.

CTTs were run by prison staff with experience of working with detainees, prison IT systems and CCTV. Protocols for undertaking contact tracing for both detainee and staff cases of COVID-19 were established. RESULTS: All prisons, and two support agencies, within the IPS now have fully functional in-prison CTTs.

Closure of live poultry markets in some affected cities dramatically reduced numbers of cases during summer of 2013, but the epidemic resurged during the winter 2013–14, increasing reported cases to 393 in Mainland China as of 30 March 2014. PURPOSE: The study aimed to explore population behavior patterns responding to an epidemic of influenza A(H7N9) virus. METHOD: Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted among 1000, 680, and 1011 respondents in December 2013, January 2014, and February 2014, with response rates of 68.0, 64.4, and 66.6 %, respectively, in Hong Kong. Adults were recruited and interviewed using random digit-dialing telephone survey. Latent class analysis was employed to explore heterogeneity in protective behavior patterns across the three surveys. Multinomial regression models were developed to determine factors associated with latent class membership. RESULTS: Three comparable latent classes were identified across the three surveys: Moderate hygiene compliance (Class 1), High hygiene compliance (Class 2), and Vigilance (Class 3). The prevalence of Class 1 was 48–52 % across the three surveys while Class 3 prevalence increased significantly from 13 % in the Dec-2013 survey to 20 % in the Feb-2014 survey. Compared with Class 1, Class 3 were more likely to be female, older, better educated, married, perceive higher susceptibility to H7N9, attribute greater severity to H7N9, report higher current worry, and anticipated worry about H7N9 infection. CONCLUSION: The three classes reflect different levels of adoption of protection and thereby may have different levels of vulnerability toward contracting H7N9 infection. It appears that as the epidemic intensifies, Class 2 (Good hygiene compliance) members are likely to transfer to Class 3 (Vigilance) while Class 1 (Moderate hygiene compliance) could be unchanged.

Microbial forensics aims at identifying: the biological agent, its source, and the individuals responsible for a biothreat event. Analytic approaches differ when the suspected biothreat agent is encountered in a container or the environment, as opposed to a human or an animal. However, once the microbe or its toxin is in the living host, all the preceding items except the microbial nucleic acid cannot be analyzed. Nevertheless, the host response to the biological agent is available for analysis. The host response to a foreign substance is often a well orchestrated series of events designed to protect the individual from any harm. Modern techniques help to elucidate the pathways and components of the host response. Similar to a live microbe, vaccines can also provoke an antibody response. A vaccine can compose of: a live or attenuated microbe, a whole nonproliferating microbe, or an antigenic part of the microbe. Regardless, the intent of the vaccine is to produce protection, often by protective antibodies.

The lockdown was first extended to May 3 soon after the analysis of this paper was completed, and then to May 18 while this paper was being revised. In this paper, we use a Bayesian extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (eSIR) model designed for intervention forecasting to study the short- and long-term impact of an initial 21-day lockdown on the total number of COVID-19 infections in India compared to other less severe non-pharmaceutical interventions. We compare effects of hypothetical durations of lockdown on reducing the number of active and new infections. We find that the lockdown, if implemented correctly, can reduce the total number of cases in the short term, and buy India invaluable time to prepare its healthcare and disease-monitoring system. Our analysis shows we need to have some measures of suppression in place after the lockdown for increased benefit (as measured by reduction in the number of cases). A longer lockdown between 42-56 days is preferable to substantially ""flatten the curve"" when compared to 21-28 days of lockdown. Our models focus solely on projecting the number of COVID-19 infections and, thus, inform policymakers about one aspect of this multi-faceted decision-making problem. We conclude with a discussion on the pivotal role of increased testing, reliable and transparent data, proper uncertainty quantification, accurate interpretation of forecasting models, reproducible data science methods and tools that can enable data-driven policymaking during a pandemic.

Descritta soprattutto nel bambino, generalmente fa seguito a un episodio infettivo o a una vaccinazione, ma può essere idiopatica. La sua presentazione clinica comprende un’encefalopatia acuta associata a segni e a sintomi neurologici multifocali. La sua diagnosi si basa sulla clinica e sulla risonanza magnetica, che rivela lesioni multifocali della sostanza bianca in ipersegnale T2 mal delimitate, della stessa età, che prendono il gadolinio e possono anche riguardare il talamo e i nuclei della base. Il liquor può mostrare un’iperlinfocitosi con iperproteinorrachia e, a volte, la presenza di bande oligoclonali transitorie. La sua prognosi è piuttosto favorevole, passato l’episodio monofasico, con un trattamento specifico. È quindi fondamentale escludere fino dall’inizio le sue molte diagnosi differenziali. Il trattamento dell’EMAD, di prima scelta, consiste in boli di corticosteroidi endovenosi a forti dosi. In caso di insuccesso bisogna ricorrere agli scambi plasmatici o alle immunoglobuline endovenose. Anche se, di solito, è monofasica, possono verificarsi altri episodi che fanno allora pensare a un’EMAD multifasica.

Yet, they have also been utilized in the treatment of various pulmonary disorders with vasoconstriction. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been implicated in the development of vasoconstrictive, proinflammatory, and pro-oxidative effects. A retrospective review was conducted on CCB use in hospitalized patients in search of any difference in outcomes related to specific endpoints: survival to discharge and progression of disease leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. The electronic medical records for all patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 that were at or above the age of 65 and that expired or survived to discharge from a community hospital in Brooklyn, NY, between the start of the public health crisis due to the viral disease up until April 13, 2020, were included. Of the 77 patients that were identified, 18 survived until discharge and 59 expired. Seven patients from the expired group were excluded since they died within one day of presentation to the hospital. Five patients were excluded from the expired group since their age was above that of the eldest patient in the survival group (89 years old). With 65 patients left, 24 were found to have been administered either amlodipine or nifedipine (CCB group) and 41 were not (No-CCB group). Patients treated with a CCB were significantly more likely to survive than those not treated with a CCB: 12 (50%) survived and 12 expired in the CCB group vs. six (14.6%) that survived and 35 (85.4%) that expired in the No-CCB treatment group (P<.01; p=0.0036). CCB patients were also significantly less likely to undergo intubation and mechanical ventilation. Only one patient (4.2%) was intubated in the CCB group whereas 16 (39.0%) were intubated in the No-CCB treatment group (P<.01; p=0.0026). Nifedipine and amlodipine were found to be associated with significantly improved mortality and a decreased risk for intubation and mechanical ventilation in elderly patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Although there have been several studies investigating prognostic factors for severe COVID-19, there have been no such studies in Korea. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study of 110 patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized at a tertiary hospital in Daegu, Korea. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were collected and analyzed. Severe disease was defined as a composite outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome, intensive care unit care, or death. RESULTS: Diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 19.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.90–193.42; P = 0.012), body temperature ≥ 37.8°C (OR, 10.91; 95% CI, 1.35–88.36; P = 0.025), peripheral oxygen saturation < 92% (OR, 33.31; 95% CI, 2.45–452.22; P = 0.008), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) > 6.3 (OR, 56.84; 95% CI, 2.64–1,223.78, P = 0.010) at admission were associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19. The likelihood of development of severe COVID-19 increased with an increasing number of prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found that diabetes mellitus, body temperature ≥ 37.8°C, peripheral oxygen saturation < 92%, and CK-MB > 6.3 are independent predictors of severe disease in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Tudor-SN protein is a ubiquitously expressed protein. Here, Tudor-SN protein was found to physiologically interact with G3BP, which is the marker and effector of SG. The kinetics of the assembly of SGs in the living cells demonstrated that Tudor-SN co-localizes with G3BP and is recruited to the same SGs in response to different stress stimuli. Knockdown of endogenous Tudor-SN did not inhibit the formation of SGs, but retarded the aggregation of small SGs into large SGs. Thus Tudor-SN may not be an initiator as essential as G3BP for the formation of SGs, but affects the aggregation of SGs. These findings identify Tudor-SN as a novel component of SGs.

Methods: Stored blood specimens from 44 patients with confirmed SARS were used along with blood samples from two sets of controls, 30 healthy volunteers who had no contact with SARS patients, and 30 healthy doctors and nurses who had contact with SARS patients but were without symptoms of SARS. Two pairs of primers were synthesized by the Shanghai Sangon Company according to SARS-CoV BJ01 strain sequence (AY278488), and then a pair of primers were designed and compared with a pair of primers published by WHO. Results: Using serial dilutions of SARS-CoV, the 44 blood samples from SARS patients specimens were tested. Using a 0.01% dilution of SARS-CoV, all 44 clinical samples tested positive in our assay. In comparison, using a 0.1% dilution of SARS-CoV, 26 of the 44 samples tested positive using the WHO primers.

Deep sequencing has the potential to reveal the mutant spectrum within a viral sample at high resolution, thus enabling the close examination of viral mutational dynamics both within- and between-hosts. The challenge however, is to accurately model the errors in the sequencing data and differentiate real viral mutations, particularly those that exist at low frequencies, from sequencing errors. RESULTS: We demonstrate that overlapping read pairs (ORP) -- generated by combining short fragment sequencing libraries and longer sequencing reads -- significantly reduce sequencing error rates and improve rare variant detection accuracy. Using this sequencing protocol and an error model optimized for variant detection, we are able to capture a large number of genetic mutations present within a viral population at ultra-low frequency levels (<0.05%).

They are species-specific organisms. Mutation and reassortment have resulted in newer viruses such as H5N1, with new resistance against anti-viral medications, and this might lead to the emergence of a fully transmissible strain, as occurred in the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. Influenza viruses are no longer just a cause of self-limited upper respiratory tract infections; the H5N1 avian influenza virus can cause severe human infection with a mortality rate exceeding 50%. The case death rate of H5N1 avian influenza infection is 20 times higher than that of the 1918 infection (50% versus 2.5%), which killed 675000 people in the USA and almost 40 million people worldwide. While the clock is still ticking towards what seems to be inevitable pandemic influenza, on April 17, 2007 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first vaccine against the avian influenza virus H5N1 for humans at high risk.

A close homologue of DC‐SIGNR, dendritic‐cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3‐grabbing non‐integrin, has been shown to act as a recycling endocytic receptor, which binds pathogens at the cell's surface and then releases them in the low pH environment of endosomal compartments. However, it is currently under debate in the literature as to whether DC‐SIGNR plays a similar role. In this work, we used NMR to explore whether the DC‐SIGNR carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) shows any pH dependence in its ability to bind carbohydrates and Ca(2+). We found clear evidence of reduced or abolished CRD‐binding affinities for three different glycans at low pH (4.2) as compared to neutral pH (6.8). We also report the assignment of the DC‐SIGNR CRD in the apo form, and use these new results to characterize the degree of structural rearrangement upon binding (or release) of Ca(2+). Finally, we report a differential effect of pH on the affinities of glycans containing mannose exclusively versus glycans containing GlcNAc moieties. Our results lead us to propose that the DC‐SIGNR CRD rapidly and reversibly releases glycan ligands and Ca(2+) at reduced pH (behaviour that would be expected for an endocytic receptor), and that the binding of mannose‐containing oligosaccharides is more strongly affected by pH than the binding of GlcNAc‐containing oligosaccharides.",2014-07-25,"Probert, Fay; Mitchell, Daniel A.; Dixon, Ann M.",FEBS J,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/40250d16b20b4fcc996834249a3744961b0a74b0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164107.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.12899; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24976257/,205135145

As clinical and diagnostic needs have evolved over the last few decades, demanding greater levels of sensitivity and accuracy, so too has PCR performance. Through optimisation, the present-day uses of real-time PCR and quantitative real-time PCR are enumerable. The technique, combined with adoption of automated processes and reduced sample volume requirements, makes it an ideal method in a broad range of clinical applications, especially in virology. Complementing serologic testing by detecting infections within the pre-seroconversion window period and infections with immunovariant viruses, real-time PCR provides a highly valuable tool for screening, diagnosing, or monitoring diseases, as well as evaluating medical and therapeutic decision points that allows for more timely predictions of therapeutic failures than traditional methods and, lastly, assessing cure rates following targeted therapies. All of these serve vital roles in the continuum of care to enhance patient management. Beyond this, quantitative real-time PCR facilitates advancements in the quality of diagnostics by driving consensus management guidelines following standardisation to improve patient outcomes, pushing for disease eradication with assays offering progressively lower limits of detection, and rapidly meeting medical needs in cases of emerging epidemic crises involving new pathogens that may result in significant health threats.",2015-12-31,"Engstrom-Melnyk, Julia; Rodriguez, Pedro L.; Peraud, Olivier; Hein, Raymond C.",Methods in Microbiology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0c281b3c1cfc20ac1c5e6e6a91b887de5304d023.json,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0580951715000069; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0580951715000069,82480269

The purpose of this study was to evaluate current guidelines for tracheostomy during the COVID‐19 pandemic to provide a framework for health systems to prepare as the science evolves over the upcoming months and years. METHODS: Literature review was performed. Articles reporting clinical practice guidelines for tracheostomy in the context of COVID‐19 were included. RESULTS: A total of 13 tracheotomy guidelines were identified. Two were available via PubMed, five in society or organization websites, and six identified via health system websites or other sources. Five were from Otolaryngology‐Head and Neck Surgery specialties, six from Anesthesiology and one from Pulmonary/Critical Care. All (100%) studies recommended postponing elective OR cases in COVID‐19 positive patients, while seven recommended reducing team members to only essential staff and three recommended forming a designated tracheostomy team. Recommendations with supporting references are summarized in the article.

This prospective cohort study of the correlates of the risk of death in COVID-19 patients was conducted at the Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care units of Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy. The clinical characteristics of all the COVID-19 patients hospitalised in the early days of the epidemic (21 February -19 March 2020) were recorded upon admission, and the time-dependent probability of death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method (censored as of 20 April 2020). Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the factors independently associated with the risk of death. Forty-eight (20.6%) of the 233 patients followed up for a median of 40 days (interquartile range 33-47) died during the follow-up. Most were males (69.1%) and their median age was 61 years (IQR 50-72). The time-dependent probability of death was 19.7% (95% CI 14.6-24.9%) 30 days after hospital admission. Age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.08, 95% CI 1.48-2.92 per ten years more) and obesity (aHR 3.04, 95% CI 1.42-6.49) were independently associated with an increased risk of death, which was also associated with critical disease (aHR 8.26, 95% CI 1.41-48.29), C-reactive protein levels (aHR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02-1.35 per 50 mg/L more) and creatinine kinase levels above 185 U/L (aHR 2.58, 95% CI 1.37-4.87) upon admission.

Expression of the putative major capsid protein VP2 in insect cells led to the formation of virus-like particles exhibiting the typical icosahedral appearance of parvoviruses with a diameter of approximately 20 nm. The expressed particles were used to establish an ELISA method, and serum samples from groups of children of various ages in China were tested for IgG antibodies against HBoV.

Ames, the virulent strain of B. anthracis, contains two plasmids that encode the antiphagocytic poly-γ-d-glutamic acid capsule and the lethal toxin. The attenuated Sterne strain of B. anthracis, which lacks the plasmid encoding capsule, is widely adapted as a vaccine strain. Although differences in the outcome of infection with the two strains may have originated from the presence or absence of an anti-phagocytic capsule, the disease pathogenesis following infection will be manifested via the host responses, which is not well understood. To gain understanding of the host responses at cellular level, a microarray analysis was performed using primary rhesus macaque AMs infected with either Ames or Sterne spores. Notably, 528 human orthologs were identified to be differentially expressed in AMs infected with either strain of the B. anthracis. Meta-analyses revealed genes differentially expressed in response to B. anthracis infection were also induced upon infections with multiple pathogens such as Francisella Novicida or Staphylococcus aureus. This suggests the existence of a common molecular signature in response to pathogen infections. Importantly, the microarray and protein expression data for certain cytokines, chemokines and host factors provide further insights on how cellular processes such as innate immune sensing pathways, anti-apoptosis versus apoptosis may be differentially modulated in response to the virulent or vaccine strain of B. anthracis.

Age and gender were not associated with clinical symptoms or the results of CT scan in children infected with SARS-CoV-2. The concentrations of white blood cells and neutrophils were higher in children with asymptomatic infection than in children with clinical symptoms or CT abnormalities. Patients who presented with CT abnormalities had lower D-dimer or lower total bilirubin than those who had normal CT scan but clinical symptoms. All children recovered and no one died or was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The mean duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was 15.4 (SD =7.2) days and similar for both asymptomatic children and children with symptoms or CT abnormalities. We found a significant negative correlation between the lymphocyte count and the duration of positive nucleic acid test. Conclusions Children with asymptomatic infection should be quarantined for the same duration as symptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The clinical significance and mechanism behind the negative correlation between the number of lymphocytes and the duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 needs further study.",2020-05-01,"Xu, Hongmei; Liu, Enmei; Xie, Jun; Smyth, Rosalind L; Zhou, Qi; Zhao, Ruiqiu; Zang, Na; Long, Xiaoru; Tang, Yuyi; Estill, Janne; Yang, Shu; Zhu, Jing; Yan, Xiaofeng; Gong, Fang; Tian, Wenguang; Zhou, Xiaqia; Mo, Yunbo; Xiao, Hongzhou; Tang, Zhengzhen; Chen, Yanni; Wang, Yi; Cui, Yuxia; Fang, Xiuling; Li, Feiyu; Tian, Yong; Li, Peibo; Deng, Quanmin; Ren, Chongsong; He, Ronghui; Li, Yi; Qin, Hong; Wang, Aiguo; Deng, Hongli; Wu, Jianguo; Meng, Wenbo; Li, Weiguo; Zhao, Yao; Luo, Zhengxiu; Wang, Zijun; Chen, Yaolong; Wong, Gary Wing Kin; Li, Qiu",Annals of translational medicine,,#609905,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566560/; https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-3192,219760020

The ancestor of all industrial penicillin producing strains, the ascomycete Penicillium chryosgenum Q176, secretes the extensively studied antifungal protein PAF. However, the genome of this strain harbours at least two more genes that code for other small, cysteine-rich and cationic proteins with potential antifungal activity. In this study, we characterized the pafB gene product that shows high similarity to PgAFP from P. chrysogenum R42C. Although abundant and timely regulated pafB gene transcripts were detected, we could not identify PAFB in the culture broth of P. chrysogenum Q176. Therefore, we applied a P. chrysogenum-based expression system to produce sufficient amounts of recombinant PAFB to address unanswered questions concerning the structure and antimicrobial function. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based analyses revealed a compact β-folded structure, comprising five β-strands connected by four solvent exposed and flexible loops and an “abcabc” disulphide bond pattern. We identified PAFB as an inhibitor of growth of human pathogenic moulds and yeasts.

Several designs in cell culture and in vivo have established basic concepts that can assist in the interpretation of evolutionary events in the field. Important information has come from cytolytic and persistent infections in cell culture that have unveiled the power of virus-cell coevolution in virus and cell diversification. Equally informative are comparisons of the response of viral populations when subjected to different passage régimes. In particular, plaque-to-plaque transfers in cell culture have revealed unusual genotypes and phenotypes that populate minority layers of viral quasispecies. Some of these viruses display properties that contradict features established in virology textbooks. Several hypotheses and principles of population genetics have found experimental confirmation in experimental designs with viruses.

METHODOLOGY: Review of the anti‐infective profile, efficacy and safety of PVP‐I in managing common upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold, influenza and tonsillo‐pharyngitis, as well as oral complications resulting from cancer treatment (oral mucositis), and dental conditions (periodontitis, caries). RESULTS: Antiseptics with broad‐spectrum anti‐infective activity and low resistance potential offer an attractive option in both infection control and prevention. While there is some evidence of benefit of antiseptics in a variety of clinical settings that include dental and oral hygiene, dermatology, oncology, and pulmonology, there appears to be discordance between the evidence‐base and practice. This is especially apparent in the management and prevention of oropharyngeal infections, for which the use of antiseptics varies considerably between clinical practices, and is in marked contrast to their dermal application, where they are extensively used as both a prophylaxis and a treatment of skin and wound infections, thus minimising the use of antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The link between oral and oropharyngeal health status and susceptibility to infection has long been recognised. The high rates of antibiotic misuse and subsequent development of bacterial resistance (e.g. increasing vancomycin‐resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)) in large parts of the world, especially across Asia Pacific, highlight the need for identifying alternative antimicrobials that would minimise the use of these medications.

TB is a major cause of illness and death worldwide, especially in Asia and Africa. Despite the fact that TB is a curable illness, the tragedy is that TB remains the biggest killer in the world as a single pathogen. The aim of this study was to determine the experiences of nurses caring for TB patients at a regional hospital in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive designs were used. A non-probability purposive sampling method was used to select the participants. The personal experiences of six nurses with more than five years’ experience caring for TB patients at a regional hospital were explored, and it was guided by data saturation. Data were collected through in-depth individual interviews. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi’s method. Trustworthiness was ensured and ethical considerations were observed in this study. The research findings revealed six major themes from the raw data: challenges of the working environment, problems impacting on the quality of nursing care, fear, anxiety, stress and risk of contracting infection, nurses’ perceptions towards patients, support structure available in the hospital, and support needs for the nurses.

We assessed temporal changes and geographical differences in risk perceptions and precautionary behaviors in response to H1N1 influenza. METHODS: 1,290 US adults completed an online survey on risk perceptions, interests in pharmaceutical interventions (preventive intervention and curative intervention), and engagement in precautionary activities (information seeking activities and taking quarantine measures) in response to H1N1 influenza between April 28 and May 27 2009. Associations of risk perceptions and precautionary behaviors with respondents' sex, age, and household size were analyzed. Linear and quadratic time trends were assessed by regression analyses. Geographic differences in risk perception and precautionary behaviors were evaluated. Predictors of willingness to take pharmaceutical intervention were analyzed. RESULTS: Respondents from larger households reported stronger interest in taking medications and engaged in more precautionary activities, as would be normatively predicted. Perceived risk increased over time, whereas interest in pharmaceutical preventive interventions and the engagement in some precautionary activities decreased over time. Respondents who live in states with higher H1N1 incidence per population perceived a higher likelihood of influenza infection, but did not express greater interests in pharmaceutical interventions, nor did they engage in a higher degree of precautionary activities. Perceived likelihood of influenza infection, willingness to take medications and engagement in information seeking activities were higher for women than men.

We produced two models to estimate areas at potential risk of HeV spillover explained by the climatic suitability for its flying fox reservoir hosts, Pteropus alecto and P. conspicillatus. We included additional climatic variables that might affect spillover risk through other biological processes (such as bat or horse behaviour, plant phenology and bat foraging habitat). Models were fit with a Poisson point process model and a log-Gaussian Cox process. In response to climate change, risk expanded southwards due to an expansion of P. alecto suitable habitat, which increased the number of horses at risk by 175–260% (110,000–165,000). In the northern limits of the current distribution, spillover risk was highly uncertain because of model extrapolation to novel climatic conditions. The extent of areas at risk of spillover from P. conspicillatus was predicted shrink. Due to a likely expansion of P. alecto into these areas, it could replace P. conspicillatus as the main HeV reservoir. We recommend: (1) HeV monitoring in bats, (2) enhancing HeV prevention in horses in areas predicted to be at risk, (3) investigate and develop mitigation strategies for areas that could experience reservoir host replacements.

AIM: To develop a mental health intervention model for inpatients that can be applied during a widespread epidemic, such as COVID-19. METHODS: In a medical team stationed in Leishenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China, we integrated onsite and online psychological support resources to implement a graded psychological intervention system. The onsite psychiatrist established trust with the patients and classified them into categories according to their symptom severity. While face-to-face evaluation and intervention are critical for effective online support, the online team effectively extended the scope of the ‘first-aid’ to all patients.

The emergence of these agents is heavily associated with zonotic animal hosts, as well as migratory pathways of infected bird vectors. The environmental survival and persistence of nucleic acid associated with these viral agents may be important for both the detection as well as the occurrence of related diseases. Our hypothesis suggests that nucleic acid from such emerging viruses may enter into a virus-parasite surrogate relationship to aid in viral persistence. We suggest that Cryptosporidium and other gastrointestinal parasites, including Giardia, could be a) a reservoir of genetic material and a environment where assortment between that genetic variation can occur and, b) a source of zoonoses through infection of the ‘target’ animal (including humans). One example which illustrates this may be the uptake dsRNA from rotavirus into cryptosporidial oocysts, as this parasite has previously been shown to contain dsRNA viral-like particles.

SP-D is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. SP-D, a collagenous calcium-dependent lectin (or collectin), binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms, and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens. SP-D also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. In addition, SP-D binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. Consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that SP-D-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids, and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of SP-D-deficient mice is altered, and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and/or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema.

Using a coupled detrended fluctuation analysis‐experimental human influenza approach, we estimated the conditional probability of moderate or severe lung airway obstruction and hence the exacerbations risk of influenza‐associated occupational asthma in individuals. The long‐range correlation exponent (α) was used as a predictor of future exacerbations risk of influenza‐associated asthma. For our illustrative distribution of PEF fluctuations and influenza‐induced asthma exacerbations risk relations, we found that the probability of exacerbations risk can be limited to below 50% by keeping α to below 0.53. This study also found that limiting wheeze scores to 0.56 yields a 75% probability of influenza‐associated asthma exacerbations risk and a limit of 0.34 yields a 50% probability that may give a representative estimate of the distribution of chronic respiratory system properties.

It was reported that viral spread may occur during the asymptomatic phase of infection, and viral load was suggested to be a useful marker to assess disease severity. In contrast to immune response against viral infections, cytotoxic T lymphocytes decline in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can be partially explained by direct invasion of T lymphocytes or apoptosis activated by SARS-CoV-2. Dysregulation of the urokinase pathway, cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein by FXa and FIIa, and consumption coagulopathy were the proposed mechanisms of the coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19.

Abstract: To determine the role of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in respiratory tract infections (RTIs) of lung transplant recipients, 60 patients were prospectively enrolled in this study spanning from September 2005 to November 2007. Community‐acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs) were identified by polymerase chain reaction and tissue culture in respiratory secretions. Of 112 RTIs, 51 were associated with ≥1 CARV, including 7 HMPV, 13 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 19 parainfluenza virus 1, 2, or 3 (PIV), 16 influenza A or B (FLU), and 3 human rhinoviruses (HRV). Sixteen CARV‐RTIs had multiple pathogens. While the standard protocol was to admit all paramyxoviral RTIs for inhaled ribavirin, 16% CARV‐RTIs required hospitalization because of the severity of their respiratory compromise, including 25% of HPMV‐single‐agent RTI, 38% of RSV single‐agent RTI, 10% of PIV‐single‐agent RTI, and 19% of multiple‐agent RTIs. None of those with non‐CARV RTIs required hospitalization. The incidence of clinically diagnosed acute graft rejection in the first 2 months after an RTI varied from 0 for single‐agent HRV to 88% for single‐agent RSV (25% for single‐agent HMPV). A new diagnosis of chronic graft rejection in the first year after an RTI was made in approximately 25% of the RTIs and did not significantly vary with the etiologic agent. No deaths occurred during this study. In conclusion, HMPV was associated with 6% of the RTIs in lung transplant recipients and its morbidity was similar to the average moribidity of CARVs.",2010-04-29,"Weinberg, A.; Lyu, D.M.; Li, S.; Marquesen, J.; Zamora, M.R.",Transpl Infect Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0e671c83a983bd01f80b474297c7da8ca7bc57aa.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169861.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3062.2010.00509.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20456714/,10395366

Guided by the crystal structure and molecular dynamics simulations, we performed systematic mutation analyses to identify residues critical for 3CL(pro) dimerization and activity in this study. Seven residues on the dimer interface were selected for evaluating their contributions to dimer stability and catalytic activity by biophysical and biochemical methods. These residues are involved in dimerization through hydrogen bonding and broadly located in the N-terminal finger, the α-helix A′ of domain I, and the oxyanion loop near the S1 substrate-binding subsite in domain II. We revealed that all seven single mutated proteases still have the dimeric species but the monomer–dimer equilibria of these mutants vary from each other, implying that these residues might contribute differently to the dimer stability. Such a conclusion could be further verified by the results that the proteolytic activities of these mutants also decrease to varying degrees. The present study would help us better understand the dimerization-activity relationship of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) and afford potential information for designing anti-viral compounds targeting the dimer interface of the protease.",2008-01-07,"Chen, Shuai; Zhang, Jian; Hu, Tiancen; Chen, Kaixian; Jiang, Hualiang; Shen, Xu",J Biochem,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/254f8f676257c70f155c7c3f891fd2183a924535.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109808.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1093/jb/mvm246; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18182387/,31694747

Indeed, the number of antiviral mAbs developed in recent years has grown exponentially. Although their direct effects on viral blunting have been studied in detail, their potential immunomodulatory actions have been overlooked until recently. The ability of antiviral mAbs to modulate antiviral immune responses in infected organisms has recently been revealed. More specifically, upon recognition of their cognate antigens, mAbs form immune complexes (ICs) that can be recognized by the Fc receptors expressed on different immune cells of infected individuals. This binding may be followed by the modulation of the host immune responses. Harnessing this immunomodulatory property may facilitate improvements in the therapeutic potential of antiviral mAbs. This review focuses on the role of ICs formed with different viral determinants and mAbs in the induction of antiviral immune responses in the context of both passive immunotherapies and vaccination strategies.

The mechanisms underlying trans- and cis-preferences are not fully understood. Here, we evaluate this concept for hepatitis C virus (HCV), an important cause of chronic liver disease and member of the Flaviviridae family. HCV encodes five nonstructural (NS) genes that are required for RNA replication. To date, only two of these genes, NS4B and NS5A, have been trans-complemented, leading to suggestions that other replicase genes work only in cis. We describe a new quantitative system to measure the cis- and trans-requirements for HCV NS gene function in RNA replication and identify several lethal mutations in the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B genes that can be complemented in trans, alone or in combination, by expressing the NS3–5B polyprotein from a synthetic mRNA. Although NS5B RNA binding and polymerase activities can be supplied in trans, NS5B protein expression was required in cis, indicating that NS5B has a cis-acting role in replicase assembly distinct from its known enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the RNA binding and NTPase activities of the NS3 helicase domain were required in cis, suggesting that these activities play an essential role in RNA template selection. A comprehensive complementation group analysis revealed functional linkages between NS3-4A and NS4B and between NS5B and the upstream NS3–5A genes. Finally, NS5B polymerase activity segregated with a daclatasvir-sensitive NS5A activity, which could explain the synergy of this antiviral compound with nucleoside analogs in patients. Together, these studies define several new aspects of HCV replicase structure-function, help to explain the potency of HCV-specific combination therapies, and provide an experimental framework for the study of cis- and trans-acting activities in positive-strand RNA virus replication more generally.",2015-04-13,"Kazakov, Teymur; Yang, Feng; Ramanathan, Harish N.; Kohlway, Andrew; Diamond, Michael S.; Lindenbach, Brett D.",PLoS Pathog,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/28f89ac0fa6a72cf3dc315817c2e670c10dec347.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4395149.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25875808/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004817,14304849

Lesion patterns, distributions, and changes at follow-up chest X-ray and/or CT were investigated. The time to progression on chest CT image, and the time to resolution of the chest CT findings were assessed. RESULTS: Lymphocytopenia was a common laboratory test abnormality. The most common CT findings were lobar consolidation with air bronchogram and ground-glass opacities. For 7 recovering patients, the time to resolution of the chest CT findings was 10–90 days. Fibrosis and traction bronchiectasis were the main features on the CT scans of recovering patients. Interestingly, the time to recovery from lymphopenia was highly consistent with time to resolution of the chest CT findings.

The replicase complex is believed to be comprised of up to 16 viral subunits and a number of cellular proteins. Besides RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RNA helicase, and protease activities, which are common to RNA viruses, the coronavirus replicase was recently predicted to employ a variety of RNA processing enzymes that are not (or extremely rarely) found in other RNA viruses and include putative sequence-specific endoribonuclease, 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease, 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase, ADP ribose 1′-phosphatase and, in a subset of group 2 coronaviruses, cyclic phosphodiesterase activities. This chapter reviews (1) the organization of the coronavirus replicase gene, (2) the proteolytic processing of the replicase by viral proteases, (3) the available functional and structural information on individual subunits of the replicase, such as proteases, RNA helicase, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and (4) the subcellular localization of coronavirus proteins involved in RNA synthesis. Although many molecular details of the coronavirus life cycle remain to be investigated, the available information suggests that these viruses and their distant nidovirus relatives employ a unique collection of enzymatic activities and other protein functions to synthesize a set of 5′-leader-containing subgenomic mRNAs and to replicate the largest RNA virus genomes currently known.",2005,"Ziebuhr, J.",Coronavirus Replication and Reverse Genetics,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ab5e4e6aae9ad85f7f0b4b6dc8b738a289bf3382.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15609509/,24407915

METHODS: A single center retrospective observational study was performed between Jan 1, 2020 and Mar 11, 2020 at Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Zhejiang, China. All patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease 2019 were enrolled, and their clinical data were gathered by reviewing electronic medical records. Outcomes of severely ill patients and non-severely ill patients were compared. RESULTS: Of 145 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the average age was 47.5 years old (standard deviation, 14.6) and 54.5% were men. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (15.2%), followed by diabetes mellitus (9.7%). Common symptoms included dry cough (81.4%), fever (75.2%), anorexia (42.8%), fatigue (40.7%), chest tightness (32.4%), diarrhea (26.9%) and dizziness (20%). According to imaging examination, 79.3% patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 18.6% showed unilateral pneumonia, 61.4% showed ground-glass opacity, and 2.1% showed no abnormal result. Compared with non-severely ill patients, severely ill patients were older (mean, years, 52.8 vs. 45.3, p < 0.01), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (16.3% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.08), had a higher body mass index (mean, 24.78 vs. 23.20, p = 0.02) and were more likely to have fever (90.7% vs. 68.6%, p = 0.01), anorexia (60.5% vs. 35.3%, p = 0.01), chest tightness (60.5% vs.20.6%, p < 0.01) and dyspnea (7.0% vs. 0%, p = 0.03).

Both scenarios could endanger life and safety of the buildings occupants. Equipping buildings with appropriate chemical sensors can alert the building occupants about the contaminant release. The readings of these sensors can be employed to trace the location of release, and help to take the appropriate actions to minimize the casualties. However, only a limited number of them can be installed due to their initial and operating cost. Moreover, there is no information about the source strength, release time and possible source location. This paper reports the development of a methodology to identify the source location using sensors reading from limited locations. The methodology uses the artificial neural network (ANN) as a statistical analysis integrated with a multi-zone airborne contaminant transport model, CONTAM. To evaluate the applicability of this method, the contaminant dispersion within a building was modeled and the results were integrated to an ANN for the source identification. The prediction made by the trained ANN was then evaluated by predicting the source of the contaminant in 40 extra cases, which had not been seen by the network during the training session. The model was able to predict the source location in more than 90% of the cases when the building was monitored by three or more sensors.

Previous studies by our group and others have demonstrated that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection could activate NF-κB in MARC-145 cells and alveolar macrophages. The nucleocapsid (N) protein was identified as an NF-κB activator among the structural proteins encoded by PRRSV; however, it remains unclear whether the nonstructural proteins (Nsps) contribute to NF-κB activation. In this study, we identified which Nsps can activate NF-κB and investigated the potential mechanism(s) by which they act. RESULTS: By screening the individual Nsps of PRRSV strain WUH3, Nsp2 exhibited great potential to activate NF-κB in MARC-145 and HeLa cells. Overexpression of Nsp2 induced IκBα degradation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Furthermore, Nsp2 also induced NF-κB-dependent inflammatory factors, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES. Compared with the Nsp2 of the classical PRRSV strain, the Nsp2 of highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strains that possess a 30 amino acid (aa) deletion in Nsp2 displayed greater NF-κB activation. However, the 30-aa deletion was demonstrated to not be associated with NF-κB activation. Further functional domain analyses revealed that the hypervariable region (HV) of Nsp2 was essential for NF-κB activation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data indicate that PRRSV Nsp2 is a multifunctional protein participating in the modulation of host inflammatory response, which suggests an important role of Nsp2 in pathogenesis and disease outcomes.",2012-04-30,"Fang, Ying; Fang, Liurong; Wang, Yang; Lei, Yingying; Luo, Rui; Wang, Dang; Chen, Huanchun; Xiao, Shaobo",Virol J,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c0f496f49f4b2dea73cf8c184ff21275bf706908.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3443020.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-83; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22546080/,15506737

HEV open reading frame-1 encodes a polypeptide comprising of the viral nonstructural proteins as well as domains of unknown function such as the macro domain (X-domain), V, DUF3729 and Y. The macro domain proteins are ubiquitously present from prokaryotes to human and in many positive-strand RNA viruses, playing important roles in multiple cellular processes. Towards understanding the function of the HEV macro domain, we characterized its interaction partners among other HEV encoded proteins. Here, we report that the HEV X-domain directly interacts with the viral methyltransferase and the ORF3 proteins. ORF3 association with the X-domain was mediated through two independent motifs, located within its N-terminal 35aa (amino acids) and C-terminal 63-123aa. Methyltransferase interaction domain was mapped to N-terminal 30-90aa. The X-domain interacted with both ORF3 and methyltransferase through its C-terminal region, involving 66(th),67(th) isoleucine and 101(st),102(nd) leucine, conserved across HEV genotypes. Furthermore, ORF3 and methyltransferase competed with each other for associating with the X-domain.

We tested nasal swab specimens by using polymerase chain reaction and genetic sequencing. RESULTS: Overall, the median age was 3.8 months (IQR 2.0–5.1 months), 56 % were male, and 90 % were born >37 weeks. RSV was detected in nasal swabs from infants (1.8 %).

A case-control study was carried out in the 2016 spring calving season. A total of 194 bobby calves, comprising 38 cases (calves that died or were condemned for health or welfare reasons before the point of slaughter) and 156 controls (calves deemed acceptable and presented for slaughter) were included in the study. Case and control calves were selected by veterinarians located at 29 processing premises across New Zealand. Information regarding management of selected calves on-farm, during transport and at the processor was obtained retrospectively via questionnaires administered to supplying farmers, transport operators and processing premises personnel. Associations between management variables and calf mortality (death or condemnation) were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. Factors associated with an increased risk of calf mortality included time in the farm of origin’s calving season, duration of travel from farm to the processor and processing slaughter schedule (same day or next day). Every additional week into the farm’s calving season increased the odds of mortality by a factor of 1.2 (95%CI 1.06, 1.35). Similarly, each additional hour of travel time increased the odds of mortality by a factor of 1.45 (95% CI 1.18, 1.76). Risk of mortality was significantly greater for calves processed at premises with a next day slaughter schedule than those processed at premises with a same day slaughter schedule (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.51, 9.67). However, when the data set was limited to those cases that died or were condemned in the yards (i.e. excluding calves that were dead or condemned on arrival) the effect of same day slaughter was not significant. In order to reduce bobby calf mortality and morbidity, transport duration should be kept as short as possible and a same day slaughter schedule applied. While these factors can be regulated, New Zealand’s pastoral dairy system means that calves will inevitably be transported for slaughter across several months each spring. Although farm management factors did not apparently influence the risk of mortality in this study, the effect of time in farm’s calving season suggests there may be farm-management related factors that change over the season. This requires further investigation.",2020-01-31,"Boulton, Alana C.; Kells, Nikki J; Cogger, Naomi; Johnson, Craig B.; O’Connor, Cheryl; Webster, Jim; Palmer, Anna; Beausoleil, Ngaio J.",Preventive Veterinary Medicine,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d7ff69edc7eb8d1fc0e31314b8a4434a50a31134.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127677.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2019.104836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31765960/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587719301874; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587719301874,208298566

In 2007, the first canine norovirus (CNV) was identified and characterized in Italy. Subsequent studies have identified CNV in stools of dogs from Portugal, Greece, and the United States. To investigate the prevalence of CNV in the UK dog population, 228 canine stool samples were screened for CNV by qPCR, and 396 serum samples were screened for anti-CNV antibodies. qPCR of RNA extracted from canine stool samples did not reveal any CNV-positive samples, based on samples collected from diarrhoeic and control dogs in 2012–2013. CNV virus-like particles to three different CNV strains were produced using recombinant baculoviruses and a seroprevalence screen undertaken. Anti-CNV antibodies were identified at significant levels in canine serum; 38.1% of samples collected between 1999–2001 and 60.1% of samples collected in 2012–2013 were seropositive. The increase in seroprevalence over time (p<0.001) suggests that the CNV strains screened for are becoming more widespread. Variation in seroprevalence to different CNV strains was also identified. Two-thirds of the dogs were seropositive to a single strain, whereas the remaining third were seropositive to two or three of the strains analysed. This study has provided the first evidence that CNV is present in the UK, with seroprevalence identified to multiple circulating strains.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to demonstrate the association of elevated IL-6 with severe Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). A total of 9 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Patients with severe COVID-19 had a significantly higher serum IL-6 levels compared to non-severe patients (mean difference (MD): 38.6 pg/mL, 95% CI: 24.3 - 52.9 pg/mL, p <0.001, I2 = 98.5%).

Given the association of elevated IL-6 with severe COVID-19 and mortality, clinicians should use this as a potential marker to recognize severe disease. IL-6 should be incorporated in a scoring system along with other inflammatory markers to risk stratify the patients for early recognition of severe disease.

Multiple studies have confirmed the presence of human bocavirus1 (HBoV1) in respiratory tract samples of children. The viral load, presentation of single detection and its role as a causative agent of severe respiratory tract infections have not been thoroughly elucidated. METHODS: We investigated the presence of HBoV1 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from 1229 children hospitalized for respiratory tract infections. The samples were analyzed for 15 respiratory viruses by PCR and 7 respiratory viruses by viral culture. RESULTS: At least one virus was detected in 652 (53.1%) of 1229 children, and two or more viruses were detected in 266 (21.6%) children. HBoV1 was detected in 127 children (10.3%), in which 66/127 (52%) of the cases were the only HBoV1 virus detected. Seasonal variation was observed with a high HBoV1 infection rate in summer. A cutoff value of 10(7) copies/mL was used to distinguish high and low HBoV1 viral loads in the nasopharyngeal aspirates. High viral loads of HBoV1 were noted predominantly in the absence of other viral agents (28/39, 71.8%) whereas there was primarily co-detection in cases of low HBoV1 viral loads (50/88, 56.8%). There were no differences in the clinical symptoms and severity between HBoV1 single detection and co-detection. In cases of HBoV1 single detection, the high viral load group was more prevalent among children with dyspnea and wheezing than was the low viral load group (42.9% vs. 23.7%, P = 0.036; 60.7% vs. 31.6%, P = 0.018). In clinical severity, a significant difference was recorded (25.0% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.003) between high viral load and low viral load groups. Of the HBoV1 positive patients associated with severe respiratory tract infections, 10/18 (55.6%) patients belonged to the HBoV1 high viral load group, and 7/10 (70%) patients had cases of HBoV1 single detection. CONCLUSIONS: HBoV1 at a high viral load is not frequently found in co-detection with other respiratory viruses, and a single detection with a high viral load could be an etiological agent of severe respiratory tract infections.

Here, we identified an original series of 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-4H-furo[3,2-c]chromen-4-one derivatives as a new class of pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors formed by two edge-fused polycyclic moieties. We show that identified compounds exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity and immunostimulatory properties, in line with recent reports linking de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis with innate defense mechanisms against viruses. Most importantly, we establish that pyrimidine deprivation can amplify the production of both type I and type III interferons by cells stimulated with retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) ligands. Altogether, our results further expand the current panel of pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors and illustrate how the production of antiviral interferons is tightly coupled to this metabolic pathway.

Since the emergence of CSFV, it has caused great economic loss in swine industry. The envelope glycoprotein E2 gene of the CSFV is an immunoprotective antigen that induces the immune system to produce neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, it is essential to study the codon usage of the E2 gene of the CSFV. In this study, 140 coding sequences of the E2 gene were analyzed. The value of effective number of codons (ENC) showed low codon usage bias in the E2 gene. Our study showed that codon usage could be described mainly by mutation pressure ENC plot analysis combined with principal component analysis (PCA) and translational selection-correlation analysis between the general average hydropathicity (Gravy) and aromaticity (Aroma), and nucleotides at the third position of codons (A3s, T3s, G3s, C3s and GC3s). Furthermore, the neutrality analysis, which explained the relationship between GC12s and GC3s, revealed that natural selection had a key role compared with mutational bias during the evolution of the E2 gene.

However, for duck enteritis virus (DEV), which is an unassigned member of the family Herpesviridae, little information is available about the function of the two proteins. In this study, the C-terminus of DEV UL26 protein (designated UL26c), which contains the whole of UL26.5, was expressed, and the recombinant UL26c protein was used to immunize BALB/c mice to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAb). The mAb 1C8 was generated against DEV UL26 and UL26.5 proteins and used subsequently to map the epitope in this region. Both the mAb and its defined epitope will provide potential tools for further study of DEV. RESULTS: A mAb (designated 1C8) was generated against the DEV UL26c protein, and a series of 17 partially overlapping fragments that spanned the DEV UL26c were expressed with GST tags. These peptides were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting analysis using mAb 1C8 to identify the epitope. A linear motif, (520)IYYPGE(525), which was located at the C-terminus of the DEV UL26 and UL26.5 proteins, was identified by mAb 1C8. The result of the ELISA showed that this epitope could be recognized by DEV-positive serum from mice. The (520)IYYPGE(525 )motif was the minimal requirement for reactivity, as demonstrated by analysis of the reactivity of 1C8 with several truncated peptides derived from the motif. Alignment and comparison of the 1C8-defined epitope sequence with those of other alphaherpesviruses indicated that the motif (521)YYPGE(525 )in the epitope sequence was conserved among the alphaherpesviruses. CONCLUSION: A mAb, 1C8, was generated against DEV UL26c and the epitope-defined minimal sequence obtained using mAb 1C8 was (520)IYYPGE(525). The mAb and the identified epitope may be useful for further study of the design of diagnostic reagents for DEV.",2010-09-13,"Liu, Xiaoli; Han, Zongxi; Shao, Yuhao; Yu, Dan; Li, Huixin; Wang, Yu; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang",Virol J,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c35ad1f1cce2ad652da7d78b1c8f6849ebf73acf.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2949831.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20836860/,10431153

We have analysed the presence of HRV in sputum specimens derived from military recruits with and without pre-diagnosed asthma at times of acute respiratory infection (CIAS Study, 2004–2005). The analysis was performed with HRV and HEV real-time RT-PCR assays. Subsequently we studied type distribution of HRV strains by genetic typing in the VP4/VP2 genomic region. In total 146 (38.8%) specimens were HRV-positive and 36 (9.3%) HEV-positive. No difference was found in HRV detection between the asthmatic vs. non-asthmatic patients. Most of the genetically typed strains, 18 (62.1%), belonged to HRV-A, while HRV-B strains constituted five (17.2%) of the HRV-positive strains. HRV-C strain was typed four times from the HRV-positive cases and a HEV-D strain twice. We further typed six HEV positive strains in the partial VP1 region.

Over the past few decades, a number of studies have been performed on bat viruses; in contrast, bacterial pathogens carried by bats were largely neglected. As more bacterial pathogens are being identified from bats, the need to study their natural microbiota is becoming urgent. In the current study, fecal samples of four bat species from different locations of China were analyzed for their microbiota composition. Together with the results of others, we concluded that bat microbiota is most commonly dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria; the strict anaerobic phylum Bacteroidetes, which is dominant in other terrestrial mammals, especially humans and mice, is relatively rare in bats. This phenomenon was interpreted as a result of a highly specified gastrointestinal tract in adaptation to the flying lifestyle of bats. Further comparative study implied that bat microbiota resemble those of the order Carnivora. To discover potential bacterial pathogens, a database was generated containing the 16S rRNA gene sequences of known bacterial pathogens. Potential bacterial pathogens belonging to 12 genera were detected such as Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia, among which some have been previously reported in bats.

Study design Seventy-five MEE samples from 54 children with no acute respiratory symptoms were studied with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of HRV/HEV and quantitative PCR for detection of HBoV. Results Twenty-six (35%) of 75 MEE samples were positive for viral nucleic acid, 22 (29%) for HEV, 10 (13%) for HRV and 2 (3%) for HBoV. There was no statistically significant difference between mucoid and serous effusions in the rate of virus detection. Forty-three percent of bilateral cases showed a contra-lateral difference in viral finding. Conclusions Our results suggest that these common respiratory viruses can be associated with OME in children. Whether these viruses are causative etiologic factors of MEE persistence or merely remnants of previous infections is not known.",2009-11-30,"Rezes, Szilárd; Söderlund-Venermo, Maria; Roivainen, Merja; Kemppainen, Kaisa; Szabó, Zsolt; Sziklai, István; Pitkäranta, Anne",Journal of Clinical Virology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7598d1ecc40728923a1240ac41ffd7d981645ee0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108299.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653209003862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19736042/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653209003862; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.08.010,11037063

These interactions will challenge the resilience of societies and systems. A comparison of plausible COVID-19 epidemic trajectories with multi-hazard time-series curves enables delineation of multi-hazard scenarios for selected countries (United States, China, Australia, Bangladesh) and regions (Texas). In multi-hazard crises, governments and other responding agents may be required to make complex, highly compromised, hierarchical decisions aimed to balance COVID-19 risks and protocols with disaster response and recovery operations. Contemporary socioeconomic changes (e.g. reducing risk mitigation measures, lowering restrictions on human activity to stimulate economic recovery) may alter COVID-19 epidemiological dynamics and increase future risks relating to natural hazards and COVID-19 interactions. For example, the aggregation of evacuees into communal environments and increased demand on medical, economic, and infrastructural capacity associated with natural hazard impacts may increase COVID-19 exposure risks and vulnerabilities. COVID-19 epidemiologic conditions at the time of a natural hazard event might also influence the characteristics of emergency and humanitarian responses (e.g. evacuation and sheltering procedures, resource availability, implementation modalities, and assistance types). A simple epidemic phenomenological model with a concurrent disaster event predicts a greater infection rate following events during the pre-infection rate peak period compared with post-peak events, highlighting the need for enacting COVID-19 counter measures in advance of seasonal increases in natural hazards. Inclusion of natural hazard inputs into COVID-19 epidemiological models could enhance the evidence base for informing contemporary policy across diverse multi-hazard scenarios, defining and addressing gaps in disaster preparedness strategies and resourcing, and implementing a future-planning systems approach into contemporary COVID-19 mitigation strategies. Our recommendations may assist governments and their advisors to develop risk reduction strategies for natural and cascading hazards during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: A dataset of 29 publically available high-resolution crystal structures of Fab-antigen complexes was collected. Contribution of APRs towards the surface areas of the Fabs buried by the cognate antigens was computed. Propensities of amino acids to occur in APRs and to be involved in antigen binding were compared. Coincidence between APRs and individual CDR loops was examined. RESULTS: All Fabs in the dataset contain at least one APR in CDR loops and adjacent framework β-strands. The average contribution of APRs towards buried surface area of Fabs is 16.0 ± 10.7%. Aggregation and antigen recognition may be coupled via aromatic residues (Tyr, Trp), which occur with high propensities in both APRs and antigen binding sites. APRs are infrequent in the heavy chain CDR 3 (H3) loops (7%), but are frequent in H2 loops (45%). CONCLUSIONS: Co-incidence of APRs with antigen recognition sites can potentially lead to the loss of function upon aggregation. Rational structure-based design or selection strategies are suggested for biotherapeutics with improved druggability while maintaining potency.

However, most studies have analyzed the consensus sequences of MERS-CoVs, precluding an investigation of intrapatient heterogeneity. Here, we analyzed non–consensus sequences to characterize intrapatient heterogeneity in cases associated with the 2015 outbreak of MERS in South Korea. Deep-sequencing analysis of MERS-CoV genomes performed on specimens from eight patients revealed significant intrapatient variation; therefore, sequence heterogeneity was further analyzed using targeted deep sequencing. A total of 35 specimens from 24 patients (including a super-spreader) were sequenced to detect and analyze variants displaying intrapatient heterogeneity. Based on the analysis of non–consensus sequences, we demonstrated the intrapatient heterogeneity of MERS-CoVs, with the highest level in the super-spreader specimen. The heterogeneity could be transmitted in a close association with variation in the consensus sequences, suggesting the occurrence of multiple MERS-CoV infections. Analysis of intrapatient heterogeneity revealed a relationship between D510G and I529T mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. These two mutations have been reported to reduce the affinity of the RBD for human CD26. Notably, although the frequency of both D510G and I529T varied greatly among specimens, the combined frequency of the single mutants was consistently high (87.7% ± 1.9% on average). Concurrently, the frequency of occurrence of the wild type at the two positions was only 6.5% ± 1.7% on average, supporting the hypothesis that selection pressure exerted by the host immune response played a critical role in shaping genetic variants and their interaction in human MERS-CoVs during the outbreak.",2016-11-23,"Park, Donghyun; Huh, Hee Jae; Kim, Yeon Jeong; Son, Dae-Soon; Jeon, Hyo-Jeong; Im, Eu-Hyun; Kim, Jong-Won; Lee, Nam Yong; Kang, Eun-Suk; Kang, Cheol In; Chung, Doo Ryeon; Ahn, Jin-Hyun; Peck, Kyong Ran; Choi, Sun Shim; Kim, Yae-Jean; Ki, Chang-Seok; Park, Woong-Yang",Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c3e25d0cb02656c82dfac2860225f14588489066.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5111008.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27900364/,14142730

In this study, we describe a novel method to produce armored hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA for use in nucleic acid tests, which was confirmed to be stable, homogeneous, noninfectious, nuclease resistant, and safe for shipping. We demonstrated that MS2 bacteriophage could successfully package double-stranded DNA of 1.3-, 3-, 3.5-, and 6.5-kb length into viral capsids with high reassembly efficiency. This is the first application of RNA bacteriophage MS2 as a platform to encapsulate double-stranded DNA, forming virus-like particles (VLPs) which were indistinguishable from native MS2 capsids in size and morphology. Moreover, by analyzing the interaction mechanism of pac site and the MS2 coat protein (CP), we found that in addition to the recognized initiation signal TR-RNA, TR-DNA can also trigger spontaneous reassembly of CP dimers, providing a more convenient and feasible method of assembly. In conclusion, this straightforward and reliable manufacturing approach makes armored DNA an ideal control and standard for use in clinical laboratory tests and diagnostics, possessing prospects for broad application, especially providing a new platform for the production of quality controls for DNA viruses.

The European Myeloma Network has provided an expert consensus statement in order to guide therapeutic decisions in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient education for personal hygiene and social distancing measures, along with treatment individualization, telemedicine and continuous surveillance for early diagnosis of COVID-19 are essential. In countries or local communities where COVID-19 infection is widely spread, MM patients should have a PCR test of nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 before hospital admission, starting a new treatment line, cell apheresis or ASCT in order to avoid ward or community spread and infections. Oral agent-based regimens should be considered, especially for the elderly and frail patients with standard risk disease, whereas de-intensified regimens for dexamethasone, bortezomib, carfilzomib and daratumumab should be used based on patient risk and response. Treatment initiation should not be postponed for patients with end organ damage, myeloma emergencies and aggressive relapses. Autologous (and especially allogeneic) transplantation should be delayed and extended induction should be administered, especially in standard risk patients and those with adequate MM response to induction. Watchful waiting should be considered for standard risk relapsed patients with low tumor burden, and slow biochemical relapses. The conduction of clinical trials should continue with appropriate adaptations to the current circumstances. Patients with MM and symptomatic COVID-19 disease should interrupt anti-myeloma treatment until recovery. For patients with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, but with no symptoms for COVID-19, a 14-day quarantine should be considered if myeloma-related events allow the delay of treatment.

METHODS: A systematic review was performed using the PRISMA guidelines. All clinical studies, reviews, consensus and guidelines related to the above medications and COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: A total of 18 articles were included. The use of analgesia, anti-inflammatories, steroids, anticoagulants, antibiotics, vitamin B, vitamin C and vitamin D and their potential impact on COVID-19 patients were reported. CONCLUSION: Eight main recommendations were derived from the review. Firstly, paracetamol remains the first line of analgesia and antipyretic. Secondly, there is no need to avoid NSAIDs for COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, opioids have the potential for immunosuppression in addition to respiratory depression and, therefore, should be prescribed with care in COVID-19 patients. Fourthly, patients with conditions where steroids are proven to be efficacious can continue to receive their steroids; otherwise, systemic steroids are not recommended for COVID-19 patients. Fifthly, orthopaedic surgeons following up on COVID-19 patients who are using steroids should continue to follow them up for possible avascular necrosis. Sixthly, whenever possible, oral anticoagulation should be converted to parental heparin. Seventhly, common orthopaedic antibiotics including penicillin and clindamycin are safe to continue for COVID-19 patients. However, for COVID-19 patients, the antibiotics can potentially be switched to macrolides and tetracyclines if the organisms are sensitive.

Antipyretic / analgesic drugs such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) are widely used to improve the comfort of the child but may cause medically unneeded antipyresis and rare but potentially serious side effects. We assess whether treatment with Pelargonium sidoides extract EPs 7630 reduces the administration of paracetamol in children with acute tonsillopharyngitis (ATP) or acute bronchitis (AB). DESIGN: Meta-analysis of randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials. METHODS: We searched clinical trial registries (ISRCTN, ClinicalTrials.gov) and medical literature (MEDLINE, EMBASE), for randomised, placebo-controlled trials investigating the administration of EPs 7630 to children with ATP or AB and reporting the co-administration of paracetamol. Based on the individual participant data of the eligible trials, study populations were characterized according to sex and age, and meta-analyses were performed for cumulative paracetamol use and ability to attend school at treatment end. RESULTS: Six trials including a total of 523 children aged 6–10 years (EPs 7630: 265; placebo: 258) and suffering from non-β-hemolytic streptococcal ATP (3 trials) or from AB (3 trials) were identified and eligible. Children received EPs 7630 or placebo for 6 (ATP) or 7 days (AB). Compared to placebo, EPs 7630 reduced the cumulative dose of paracetamol in 5 out of the 6 trials, by an average of 244 mg (Hedges’ g; − 0.28; 95% confidence interval: [− 0.53; − 0.02]; p < 0.03). At treatment end, 30.2% (EPs 7630) and 74.4% (placebo) of the children were still unable to attend school (risk ratio: 0.43; 95% confidence interval: [0.29; 0.65]; p < 0.001).

IBV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome ~27 kb in length and, like all coronaviruses, produces a set of sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNAs) synthesised via the viral polymerase. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) to delineate gene expression in the IBV M41-CK and Beau-CK strains at sub-codon resolution. Quantification of reads flanking the programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal at the genomic RNA ORF1a/ORF1b junction revealed that PRF in IBV is highly efficient (33–40%), consistent with in vitro measurements. Triplet phasing of the profiling data allowed precise determination of reading frames and revealed the translation of two intergenic genes (4b and 4c on sgmRNA4), which are widely conserved across IBV isolates. RNASeq revealed two novel transcription junction sites in the attenuated Beau-CK strain, one of which would generate a sgmRNA encoding a ribosomally occupied ORF in the viral 3’ untranslated region (dORF). Within IBV transcripts, the nucleocapsid (N) protein was unexpectedly found to be inefficiently translated, despite being an abundant structural component of mature IBV virions. Finally, we demonstrate that the host cell response to IBV occurs primarily at the level of transcription, with a global up-regulation of immune-related mRNA transcripts following infection, and comparatively modest changes in the translation efficiencies of host genes. IMPORTANCE IBV is a major avian pathogen and presents a substantial economic burden to the poultry industry. Improved vaccination strategies are urgently needed to curb the global spread of this pathogen, and the development of suitable vaccine candidates will be aided by an improved understanding of IBV molecular biology. Our high-resolution data have enabled a precise study of transcription and translation in both pathogenic and attenuated forms of IBV, and expand our understanding of gammacoronaviral gene expression. We demonstrate that gene expression shows considerable intra-species variation, with single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with altered production of sgmRNA transcripts, and our RiboSeq data sets enabled us to uncover novel ribosomally occupied ORFs in both strains. We also identify numerous cellular genes and gene networks that are differentially expressed during virus infection, giving insights into the host cell reponse to IBV infection.",2019-04-18,"Dinan, Adam M.; Keep, Sarah; Bickerton, Erica; Britton, Paul; Firth, Andrew E.; Brierley, Ian",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/152f63d871ed805dd8407e2470acba88a61816e3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7e6bd4f9d794f87445f67c9ed9d5699706040fa4.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/612614,145939768

Several departments have reported their experiences and protocols to provide insights for others impacted. The goals of this study are to report the load and variety of neurosurgical cases and clinic visits after discontinuing the COVID-19 Battle Plan at an academic tertiary care referral center too provide insights for other departments going through the same transition. Methods The clinical data of all patients who underwent a neurosurgical intervention between May 4, 2020 and June 4, 2020 was obtained from a prospectively maintained database. Data of the control group was retrospectively collected from the medical records to compare the types of surgeries/interventions and clinic visits performed by the same neurosurgical service before the COVID-19 pandemic started. Results One-hundred sixty-one patients underwent neurosurgical interventions, and seven-hundred one patients were seen in clinic appointments, in the four-week period following easing back from our COVID-19 ‘Battle Plan’. Discontinuing the ‘Battle Plan’ resulted in increases in case load to above average practice after a week but a continued decrease in clinic appointments throughout the four weeks compared to average practice. Conclusions As policy-shaping crises like pandemics abate, easing back to ‘typical’ practice can be completed effectively by appropriately allocating resources.

However, it is not known how robust these rate estimates are to inaccuracies in the data, particularly in sampling dates that are used for molecular clock calibration. Here we report on the rate of evolution of the emerging pathogen Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), which has significantly different rates of evolution for the same outer capsid (VP60) gene published in the literature. In an attempt to reconcile the conflicting data and further elucidate details of RHDV ’s evolutionary history, we undertook fresh Bayesian analyses and employed jackknife control methods to produce robust substitution rate and time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) estimates for RHDV based on the VP60 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes. RESULTS: Through these control methods, we were able to identify a single misdated taxon, a passaged lab strain used for vaccine production, which was responsible for depressing the RHDV capsid gene’s rate of evolution by 65%. Without this isolate, the polymerase and the capsid protein genes had nearly identical rates of evolution: 1.90x10(-3) nucleotide substitutions/site/year, ns/s/y, (95% highest probability density (HPD) 1.25x10(-3)-2.55x10(-3)) and 1.91x10(-3) ns/s/y (95% HPD 1.50x10(-3)-2.34x10(-3)), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: After excluding the misdated taxon, both genes support a significantly higher substitution rate as well as a relatively recent emergence of RHDV, and obviate the need for previously hypothesized decades of unobserved diversification of the virus. The control methods show that using even one misdated taxon in a large dataset can significantly skew estimates of evolutionary parameters and suggest that it is better practice to use smaller datasets composed of taxa with unequivocal isolation dates. These jackknife controls would be useful for future tip-calibrated rate analyses that include taxa with ambiguous dates of isolation.",2012-05-30,"Hicks, Allison L; Duffy, Siobain",BMC Evol Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ce0df4a52a142b05d4967e8ff626b87f2e435d9e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3426481.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-12-74; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22646287/,872194

So far, the structure determination of the SARS-CoV NP CTD in solution has been impeded by the poor quality of NMR spectra, especially for aromatic resonances. We have recently developed the stereo-array isotope labeling (SAIL) method to overcome the size problem of NMR structure determination by utilizing a protein exclusively composed of stereo- and regio-specifically isotope-labeled amino acids. Here, we employed the SAIL method to determine the high-quality solution structure of the SARS-CoV NP CTD by NMR. The SAIL protein yielded less crowded and better resolved spectra than uniform 13C and 15N labeling, and enabled the homodimeric solution structure of this protein to be determined. The NMR structure is almost identical with the previously solved crystal structure, except for a disordered putative RNA-binding domain at the N-terminus. Studies of the chemical shift perturbations caused by the binding of single-stranded DNA and mutational analyses have identified the disordered region at the N-termini as the prime site for nucleic acid binding. In addition, residues in the β-sheet region also showed significant perturbations. Mapping of the locations of these residues onto the helical model observed in the crystal revealed that these two regions are parts of the interior lining of the positively charged helical groove, supporting the hypothesis that the helical oligomer may form in solution.",2008-07-18,"Takeda, Mitsuhiro; Chang, Chung-ke; Ikeya, Teppei; Güntert, Peter; Chang, Yuan-hsiang; Hsu, Yen-lan; Huang, Tai-huang; Kainosho, Masatsune",Journal of Molecular Biology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/58c67994f47dc6c8b552cff7de2892719259ec52.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094413.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18561946/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283607015938; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283607015938; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2007.11.093,206201055

METHODS: From January 19 to February 6, 2020, 88 confirmed COVID-19 patients presenting with pneumonia and 80 non-COVID-19 patients suffering from pneumonia of other origins were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical data and laboratory results were collected. CT features and scores were evaluated at the segmental level according to the lesions’ position, attenuation, and form. Scores were calculated based on the size of the pneumonia lesion, which graded at the range of 1 to 4. Air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, crazy-paving pattern, subpleural curvilinear line, bronchiectasis, air space, pleural effusion, and mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy were also evaluated. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that history of exposure (β = 3.095, odds ratio (OR) = 22.088), leukocyte count (β = − 1.495, OR = 0.224), number of segments with peripheral lesions (β = 1.604, OR = 1.604), and crazy-paving pattern (β = 2.836, OR = 2.836) were used for establishing the predictive model to identify COVID-19-positive patients (p < 0.05). In this model, values of area under curve (AUC) in the training and testing groups were 0.910 and 0.914, respectively (p < 0.001). A predicted score for COVID-19 (PSC-19) was calculated based on the predictive model by the following formula: PSC-19 = 2 × history of exposure (0–1 point) − 1 × leukocyte count (0–2 points) + 1 × peripheral lesions (0–1 point) + 2 × crazy-paving pattern (0–1 point), with an optimal cutoff point of 1 (sensitivity, 88.5%; specificity, 91.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Our predictive model and PSC-19 can be applied for identification of COVID-19-positive cases, assisting physicians and radiologists until receiving the results of reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. KEY POINTS: • Prediction of RT-PCR positivity is crucial for fast diagnosis of patients suspected of having coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). • Typical CT manifestations are advantageous for diagnosing COVID-19 and differentiation of COVID-19 from other types of pneumonia. • A predictive model and scoring system combining both clinical and CT features were herein developed to enable high diagnostic efficiency for COVID-19.",2020-07-01,"Qin, Le; Yang, Yanzhao; Cao, Qiqi; Cheng, Zenghui; Wang, Xiaoyang; Sun, Qingfeng; Yan, Fuhua; Qu, Jieming; Yang, Wenjie",Eur Radiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/efa2085e73df357c930d24ae126cf006ca7bda16.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7326621.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32607634/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07022-1,220281302

The virus may contaminate live canine vaccines based on cultured feline cells. The in vivo infectivity, acute and subacute pathogenicity, and viral proliferation of the RD114 virus were evaluated by experimental infection of dogs. METHODS: Nine specific pathogen free dogs were divided into three groups, with each group consisting of one female and two male dogs. Dogs were subcutaneously inoculated in the neck with either 1 ml RD114 stock virus (group A), inactivated RD114 virus suspension (group B), or cell culture medium (group C) as a negative control. To assess blood cell counts and biochemical properties, blood samples from each group were collected 5 days before inoculation, just prior to inoculation, and 1, 3, 7 and 10 days post-inoculation. RESULT: During the experimental period of 51 days, none of the dogs inoculated with RD114 virus showed any clinical signs, significant increases in rectal temperature or abnormal blood biochemical characteristics including C-reactive protein when compared with the negative controls. We were not able to re-isolate the RD114 virus from buffy coat cells of group A dogs. Additionally, we could not detect RD114 provirus in the genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes, lymph node, spleen and sternal bone marrow cells. CONCLUSIONS: Signs of RD114 virus proliferation were not found after subcutaneous infection of dogs. Although the potential risk caused by infection with RD114 virus in dogs could not be assessed in this study, we suspect that RD114 virus has little or no virulence in dogs.",2011-01-27,"Narushima, Rie; Horiuchi, Noriyuki; Usui, Tatsufumi; Ogawa, Takashi; Takahashi, Toshio; Shimazaki, Tomoaki",Acta Vet Scand,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4c6a45d1e56660fa713b637825b96e287a0acef5.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3038973.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21269522/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-53-3,3038371

The small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) tag is industrially practical for increasing the yield of recombinant proteins by increasing solubility and preventing degradation in expression systems. RESULTS: A new vector system, pKSEC1, was designed to produce AMPs, which can work in prokaryotic systems such as Escherichia coli and plant chloroplasts. 6xHis was tagged to SUMO for purification of SUMO-fused AMPs. Abaecin, a 34-aa-long antimicrobial peptide from honeybees, was expressed in a fusion form to 6xHis-SUMO in a new vector system to evaluate the prokaryotic expression platform of the antimicrobial peptides. The fusion sequences were codon-optimized in three different combinations and expressed in E. coli. The combination of the native SUMO sequence with codon-optimized abaecin showed the highest expression level among the three combinations, and most of the expressed fusion proteins were detected in soluble fractions. Cleavage of the SUMO tag by sumoase produced a 29-aa-long abaecin derivative with a C-terminal deletion. However, this abaecin derivative still retained the binding sequence for its target protein, DnaK. Antibacterial activity of the 29-aa long abaecin was tested against Bacillus subtilis alone or in combination with cecropin B. The combined treatment of the abaecin derivative and cecropin B showed bacteriolytic activity 2 to 3 times greater than that of abaecin alone. CONCLUSIONS: Using a SUMO-tag with an appropriate codon-optimization strategy could be an approach for the production of antimicrobial peptides in E.coli without affecting the viability of the host cell.

Our objective was to study innate responses induced early following IBV infection in chickens. Initiation of the transcription of selected innate immune genes such as TLR3, TLR7, MyD88, IL-1β and IFN-β, as well as recruitment of macrophages, were evident following an initial down regulation of some of the observed genes (TLR3, IL-1β, and IFN-γ) in trachea and lung.

Methods Hospital and ED data were drawn from California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). DV-related hospitalizations and ED visits in California were analyzed between January 2000 and September 2015 (53,596), along with total medical costs. Time series were divided into pre-recession (Jan 2000-Nov 2007) and recession/post-recession (Dec 2007-Sept 2015) periods. Results The medical cost of DV-related hospitalizations alone was estimated as $1,136,165,861. A dramatic increase in DV episodes was found potentially associated with the Great Recession. The number of ED visits per month tripled from pre- to post-recession (104.9 vs. 290.6), along with an increased number of hospitalizations (77.1 vs. 95.6); African Americans and Native Americans were disproportionally impacted. In addition, psychiatric comorbidities, severe DV episodes, in-hospital mortality and charge per hospitalization escalated. The rise in DV hospitalizations and ED visits beginning in December 2007 was mainly attributable to physical abuse episodes in adults; minors had no change in DV trends.

This study was aimed to compare the strength of associations between different cognitive and affective measures of risk and self-reported protective behaviors in a series of ten cross-sectional surveys conducted throughout the first wave of influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. METHODS: All surveys were conducted using questionnaire-based telephone interviews, with random digit dialing to recruit adults from the general population. Measures of anxiety and worry (affective) and perceived risk (cognitive) regarding A/H1N1 were made in 10 serial surveys. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the cognitive/affective-behavioral associations in each survey while multilevel logistic models were conducted to estimate the average effects of each cognitive/affective measure on adoption of protective behaviors throughout the ten surveys. RESULTS: Excepting state anxiety, other affective measures including “anticipated worry”, “experienced worry” and “current worry” specific to A/H1N1 risk were consistently and strongly associated with adoption of protective behaviors across different survey periods. However, the cognitive-behavioral associations were weaker and inconsistent across the ten surveys. Perceived A/H1N1 severity relative to SARS had stronger associations with adoption of protective behaviors in the late epidemic periods than in the early epidemic periods. CONCLUSION: Risk-specific worries appear to be significantly associated with the adoption of protective behaviors at different epidemic stages, whereas cognitive measures may become more important in understanding people’s behavioral responses later in epidemics.

This is in many ways surprising. As demonstrated in the work of Deacon on the ‘globalization of social policy’, global social policy has been animated and debated not only at the multilateral level but at the regional level as well. But at least in the diplomatic literature, the importance of this regional dynamic (with a focus on diverse sites and actors and the pursuit of democratic control) has been missed. The objective of this article is to explore whether health diplomacy is catching up to this larger debate re-shaping the conceptualization and practice of diplomacy more generally. In some ways, the results may be counter-productive in that this shift may encourage an increasingly fragmented process. Yet, it may also point to some breakthroughs, with diplomats, acting as ‘go to’ personnel on the front lines of operational activity, enabling actors to integrate with one another to produce effective governance. In doing so, the regional dimension is given greater recognition as a component of health diplomacy, albeit in an uneven and sometimes awkward manner.

The number of involved lobes and CT score after an exacerbation significantly increased to 5 (5–5) and 12 (9–14), respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that, when the cutoff value of CT score was 5, the sensitivity and specificity for severe pneumonia were 90% and 70%, respectively. CT findings of ground glass opacity with consolidations (91.7%), bilateral distribution (100.0%), and multifocal lesion (100.0%) were features in found in patients after exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant changes in clinical, laboratory, and CT findings in patients from disease onset to exacerbation. An increase in the number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict poor clinical outcomes. Combining an assessment of CT changes with clinical and laboratory changes could help clinical teams evaluate the prognosis. KEY POINTS: • The common chest CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia after exacerbation were ground glass opacity (GGO) with consolidation, bilateral distribution, and multifocal lesions. • An increase in number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict a poor clinical outcome. • Worsened symptoms and abnormal laboratory results are also associated with poor prognosis.",2020-05-08,"Liu, Jiayi; Chen, Taili; Yang, Haitao; Cai, Yeyu; Yu, Qizhi; Chen, Juan; Chen, Zhu; Shang, Quan-Liang; Ma, Cong; Chen, Xiangyu; Xiao, Enhua",Eur Radiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0e4a5db98959ebbf76c61cfe584e518f64be7bda.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205907.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385648/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-06916-4,218540222

Otters are widely spread through Portugal, and scats have been extensively used in ecology studies; however, valid information on their microbiota is scarce. This work represents a first approach to characterise the otter faecal microflora in samples collected in river stretches of the Sado river basin (Portugal) during winter 2006. Eight sampling stretches of 8 km were selected, and from each, six to eight sampling sites were visited. A total of 31 scats were analysed. The microflora studied included aerobic bacteria, spore-forming anaerobic bacteria and viruses (coronavirus, parvovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus). Bacterial isolates were identified based on morphology and metabolic pathways, and virus detection was performed by polymerase chain reaction. The results revealed the high degree of bacterial diversity in the faecal microflora of L. lutra. A total of 88 Gram-negative (23 genera) and 44 Gram-positive isolates (ten genera) were identified. The identification of four isolates was inconclusive, and their identification was performed by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequencing, which confirms the need for biochemical testing optimisation regarding animal isolates. None of the scats was positive for virus detection.

AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States is not well-described. Objective: To provide information about frequency, outcomes and recovery associated with AKI and dialysis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Design: Observational, retrospective study. Setting: Admitted to hospital between February 27 and April 15, 2020. Participants: Patients aged [≥]18 years with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 Exposures: AKI (peak serum creatinine increase of 0.3 mg/dL or 50% above baseline). Main Outcomes and Measures: Frequency of AKI and dialysis requirement, AKI recovery, and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with mortality. We also trained and tested a machine learning model for predicting dialysis requirement with independent validation. Results: A total of 3,235 hospitalized patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. AKI occurred in 1406 (46%) patients overall and 280 (20%) with AKI required renal replacement therapy. The incidence of AKI (admission plus new cases) in patients admitted to the intensive care unit was 68% (553 of 815). In the entire cohort, the proportion with stages 1, 2, and 3 AKI were 35%, 20%, 45%, respectively. In those needing intensive care, the respective proportions were 20%, 17%, 63%, and 34% received acute renal replacement therapy. Independent predictors of severe AKI were chronic kidney disease, systolic blood pressure, and potassium at baseline. In-hospital mortality in patients with AKI was 41% overall and 52% in intensive care. The aOR for mortality associated with AKI was 9.6 (95% CI 7.4-12.3) overall and 20.9 (95% CI 11.7-37.3) in patients receiving intensive care. 56% of patients with AKI who were discharged alive recovered kidney function back to baseline. The area under the curve (AUC) for the machine learned predictive model using baseline features for dialysis requirement was 0.79 in a validation test. Conclusions and Relevance: AKI is common in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, associated with worse mortality, and the majority of patients that survive do not recover kidney function.

To track the behavior of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in the infected cells in real time, we produced an infectious recombinant ASFV (B54GFP-2) that expresses and incorporates into the virus particle a chimera of the p54 envelope protein fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The incorporation of the fusion protein into the virus particle was confirmed immunologically and it was determined that p54-EGFP was fully functional by confirmation that the recombinant virus made normal-sized plaques and presented similar growth curves to the wild-type virus. The tagged virus was visualized as individual fluorescent particles during the first stages of infection and allowed to visualize the infection progression in living cells through the viral life cycle by confocal microscopy. In this work, diverse potential applications of B54GFP-2 to study different aspects of ASFV infection are shown. By using this recombinant virus it was possible to determine the trajectory and speed of intracellular virus movement. Additionally, we have been able to visualize for first time the ASFV factory formation dynamics and the cytophatic effect of the virus in live infected cells.

This sequence functions as a retrieval signal at post-ER compartment(s), but the exact compartment(s) where the retrieval occurs remains unresolved. With an affinity-purified antibody against the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the mammalian KDEL receptor, we have investigated its subcellular localization using immunogold labeling on thawed cryosections of different tissues, such as mouse spermatids and rat pancreas, as well as HeLa, Vero, NRK, and mouse L cells. We show that rab1 is an excellent marker of the intermediate compartment, and we use this marker, as well as budding profiles of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in cells infected with this virus, to identify this compartment. Our results demonstrate that the KDEL receptor is concentrated in the intermediate compartment, as well as in the Golgi stack. Lower but significant labeling was detected in the rough ER. In general, only small amounts of the receptor were detected on the trans side of the Golgi stack, including the trans- Golgi network (TGN) of normal cells and tissues. However, some stress conditions, such as infection with vaccinia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus, as well as 20 degrees C or 43 degrees C treatment, resulted in a significant shift of the distribution towards the trans- TGN side of the Golgi stack. This shift could be quantified in HeLa cells stably expressing a TGN marker. No significant labeling was detected in structures distal to the TGN under all conditions tested. After GTP gamma S treatment of permeabilized cells, the receptor was detected in the beta-COP-containing buds/vesicles that accumulate after this treatment, suggesting that these vesicles may transport the receptor between compartments. We propose that retrieval of KDEL- containing proteins occurs at multiple post-ER compartments up to the TGN along the exocytotic pathway, and that within this pathway, the amounts of the receptor in different compartments varies according to physiological conditions.",1994-12-02,,J Cell Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e14c267f2323c8a137e2698dcf29a87713898166.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7798312/,18199705

The anti-parasitic effects of ursolic acid against T. gondii-infected cells and T. gondii were evaluated through different specific assays, including immunofluorescence staining and animal testing. Ursolic acid effectively inhibited the proliferation of T. gondii when compared with sulfadiazine, and consistently induced anti-T. gondii activity/effect. In particular, the formation of parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) in host cells was markedly decreased after treating ursolic acid, which was effectively suppressed. Moreover, the survival rate of T. gondii was strongly inhibited in T. gondii group treated with ursolic acid, and then 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) against T. gondii was measured as 94.62 μg/mL. The T. gondii-infected mice treated with ursolic acid indicated the same survival rates and activity as the normal group. These results demonstrate that ursolic acid causes anti-T. gondii action and effect by strongly blocking the proliferation of T. gondii through the direct and the selective T. gondii-inhibitory ability as well as increases the survival of T. gondii-infected mice.

However, the information found on the internet often lacks scientific rigor, as anyone may upload content. This factor is a cause of great concern to scientific societies, governments, and users. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the information about the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the internet. METHODS: On February 29, 2020, we performed a Google search with the terms “Prevention coronavirus,” “Prevention COVID-19,” “Prevención coronavirus,” and “Prevención COVID-19”. A univariate analysis was performed to study the association between the type of authorship, country of publication, and recommendations to avoid COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS: In total, 80 weblinks were reviewed. Most of them were produced in the United States and Spain (n=58, 73%) by digital media sources and official public health organizations (n=60, 75%). The most mentioned WHO preventive measure was “wash your hands frequently” (n=65, 81%). A less frequent recommendation was to “stay home if you feel unwell” (n=26, 33%). The analysis by type of author (official public health organizations versus digital media) revealed significant differences regarding the recommendation to wear a mask when you are healthy only if caring for a person with suspected COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 4.39).

Both epidemiological and laboratory studies have shown that ambient temperature could affect the transmission and survival of coronaviruses. This study aimed to determine whether the temperature is an essential factor in the infection caused by this novel coronavirus. METHODS: Daily confirmed cases and meteorological factors in 122 cities were collected between January 23, 2020, to February 29, 2020. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the nonlinear relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases. We also used a piecewise linear regression to determine the relationship in detail. RESULTS: The exposure-response curves suggested that the relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases was approximately linear in the range of <3 °C and became flat above 3 °C. When mean temperature (lag0–14) was below 3 °C, each 1 °C rise was associated with a 4.861% (95% CI: 3.209–6.513) increase in the daily number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. These findings were robust in our sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mean temperature has a positive linear relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases with a threshold of 3 °C. There is no evidence supporting that case counts of COVID-19 could decline when the weather becomes warmer, which provides useful implications for policymakers and the public.",2020-07-01,"Xie, Jingui; Zhu, Yongjian",Sci Total Environ,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4f0c57ad6737d28e7e518b07ac1113bf3cd6c7b7.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7142675.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408450/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720317149; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720317149,214755597

To reveal the hepatic injury related to this disease and its clinical significance, we conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study that included 5,771 adult patients with COVID‐19 pneumonia in Hubei Province. We reported the distributional and temporal patterns of liver injury indicators in these patients and determined their associated factors and death risk. Longitudinal liver function tests were retrospectively analyzed and correlated with the risk factors and death. Liver injury dynamic patterns differed in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TBIL). AST elevated first, followed by ALT, in severe patients. ALP modestly increased during hospitalization and largely remained in the normal range. The fluctuation in TBIL levels was mild in the non‐severe and the severe group. AST abnormality was associated with the highest mortality risk compared to other indicators of liver injury during hospitalization. Common factors associated with elevated liver injury indicators were lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count increase, and male gender. CONCLUSION: The dynamic patterns of liver injury indicators and their potential risk factors may provide an important explanation for the COVID‐19‐associated liver injury. Because elevated liver injury indicators, particularly AST, are strongly associated with the mortality risk, our study indicates that these parameters should be monitored during hospitalization.",2020-05-02,"Lei, Fang; Liu, Ye‐Mao; Zhou, Feng; Qin, Juan‐Juan; Zhang, Peng; Zhu, Lihua; Zhang, Xiao‐Jing; Cai, Jingjing; Lin, Lijin; Ouyang, Shan; Wang, Xiaoming; Yang, Chengzhang; Cheng, Xu; Liu, Weifang; Li, Haomiao; Xie, Jing; Wu, Bin; Luo, Huiming; Xiao, Fei; Chen, Jing; Tao, Liang; Cheng, Gang; She, Zhi‐Gang; Zhou, Jianghua; Wang, Haitao; Lin, Jun; Luo, Pengcheng; Fu, Shouzhi; Zhou, Jihui; Ye, Ping; Xiao, Bing; Mao, Weiming; Liu, Liming; Yan, Youqin; Liu, Ling; Chen, Guohua; Li, Hongliang; Huang, Xiaodong; Zhang, Bing‐Hong; Yuan, Yufeng",Hepatology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/739e2d7e203399a2aebd6d9c5547021ef82edf00.json,,https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.31301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32359177/,218483694

Here, we present large-scale single-cell transcriptomic analysis of viral antigen-reactive CD4+ T cells from 32 COVID-19 patients. In patients with severe disease compared to mild disease, we found increased proportions of cytotoxic follicular helper (TFH) cells and cytotoxic T helper cells (CD4-CTLs) responding to SARS-CoV-2, and reduced proportion of SARS-CoV-2 reactive regulatory T cells. Importantly, the CD4-CTLs were highly enriched for the expression of transcripts encoding chemokines that are involved in the recruitment of myeloid cells and dendritic cells to the sites of viral infection. Polyfunctional T helper (TH)1 cells and TH17 cell subsets were underrepresented in the repertoire of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells compared to influenza-reactive CD4+ T cells.
