This hypothesis is confirmed by the histological examination of the lungs of in patients with SARS-CoV-2[4]. Indeed, it showed histological signs like-minded with ARDS [4], including bilateral acute changes with diffuse alveolar damages, vascular congestion and extensive microvascular damages [4].Our findings support this hypothesis. In fact, lung damages observed on chest CT-scan, exist despite a normal cardiac function in two patients.

In our COVID-19 department, the diagnosis of pulmonary capillary leak syndrome following COVID-19 virus infection was established by a medical committee of 6 physicians of ours.
