Many patients will experience a delay in operative emergency treatment, resulting in longer courses and higher doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) analgesic use than are familiar to dentists. Table 1 shows suggested analgesic regimes in primary care for moderate and severe dental pain in adults, but the aim is to prescribe and advise the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration needed. Dentists must be aware of the adverse effects and medical cautions in these circumstances in order to safely advise their patients and to know when it is appropriate to liaise with the patient's GP for provision of analgesia. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on the use of NSAIDs in patients with pre-existing medical conditions is available, 3 and the British National Formulary (BNF) and the BNF App are available for guidance.",
