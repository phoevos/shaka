Importantly, OA is the most common age-related joint disease affecting more than 80% of people older than the age of 55, an age burden also shared with the highest severity in COVID-19 patients. OA patients often show a large array of concomitant pathologies such as diabetes, inflammation and cardiovascular diseases that are again shared with COVID-19 patients and may therefore increase complications. Moreover, different OA treatments such as NSAIDs, paracetamol, corticosteroids, opioids or other molecules have a wide array of iatrogenic effects, potentially increasing COVID-19 secondary infection incidence or complications. In this review we critically analyse the evidences on either negative or positive effect of drugs commonly used to manage OA in this particular scenario.

Nevertheless, some estimations outnumber the confirmed cases by orders of magnitude, with the possible prevalence of infection up to the 10% of the population in some countries (13) , and it is highly likely that a wide portion of individuals suffering from other common conditions, such as osteoarthritis, may have being infected by SARS-CoV-2.

            "text": "The molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been partially elucidated by recent reports that identified the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the host cell surface receptor allowing for the viral infection (15) . This protein is expressed in a number of tissues including alveolar epithelial cells, vascular endothelium, oral mucosa and it is responsible for the cleavage of Angiotensin I and Angiotensin II (16) , playing a regulatory function in the heart (17) and possibly a protective role in lung diseases (18) . COVID-19, similarly to other viral infections such as SARS-CoV in general and H5N1, causes a decrease of ACE2 expression, partially explaining the severity of the lung damage in the pathology (19, 20) . Then, the treatment of pathologies such as hypertension, requiring ACE-inhibitors administration, may accelerate the progression of the pathology, even if the evidences are still insufficient to balance the cost/benefit equilibrium towards the suspension of these therapies in all patients undergoing this treatment (21) . In this frame of cost/benefit balance, ACE-inhibitors also lead to upregulation of ACE2 expression (22), eventually dealing with a double-edge sword by increasing protection for lung tissue function at the cost of potentially increased infectivity. Beside the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 pathology may exhibit three grades of increasing severity, from early infection to pulmonary involvement and eventual systemic hyperinflammation (23) . Usually the grades are associated with the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, IL-2, IL-8 and TNF\u03b1, or chemokines, that are significantly elevated in those patients with a more severe disease (23) . The high levels of these cytokines have been also reported to be inversely related to the absolute lymphocytes count (24) . Since an effective immune response against viral infections depends on cytotoxic T cells activation (25) , experimental evidence supports the observation that overexpression of inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 during the viral immune response might be associated with a decreased viral clearance by impairing the polarization and functionality of Th1 and CD8 cells (26), contributing to the worsening of the COVID-19 symptoms, and their management may appear an intriguing therapeutical approach.",

A recent meta-analysis showed that the most prevalent COVID-19 comorbidities were hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus (21, 32) , and their presence increased life threatening complications. In this frame, it was recently reported that obesity may be a trigger to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality (33) . Similar outcomes are expected also for diabetes patients (34) , following what was stated for the two earlier CoV infections, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 (35) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 (36) . Consistently, a recent report indicated diabetes as a risk factor significantly associated with COVID-19 unfavourable clinical outcomes (37) . Also, arterial hypertension may be associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 infected subjects (38) . Regarding CVD, pre-existing cardiovascular pathologies increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, and COVID-19 itself causes serious cardiac sequelae (39) . As a consequence, although a direct relationship between COVID-19 mortality and morbidity in OA patients has not been reported yet, the presence of OA-related concomitant disorders might trigger the life-threatening risks for OA patients in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

In OA patients, they are administered both systemically and, more often, intra-articularly (IA). Among others, prednisone is the most prescribed systemic steroid (66) and other few molecules have FDA (methylprednisolone, triamcinolone, betamethasone and dexamethasone) or EMA (methylprednisolone, triamcinolone) labels for intra-articular injections (67) . CS have both antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, and their mechanism of action is complex. It includes inhibition of accumulation of inflammatory cells, metalloproteases and metalloprotease activators, and synthesis and secretion of pro-inflammatory factors (68) . Long-term systemic (oral or parenteral) use of these agents is associated with adverse events like, among others, diabetes and hyperglycaemia, osteoporosis, superinfection, CVD and immunosuppression (69) . For intraarticular administration, adverse events are less likely, probably due to serum cortisol levels decreasing within hours and recovery to baseline in 1-4 weeks. Nevertheless, IA CS resulted in reduction of inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate that can last for months, and in a transient increase in blood glucose levels in diabetic OA patients (70) , despite this treatment often shows short-term benefits. To avoid this pitfall, triamcinolone acetonide extended release, produced using microsphere technology, was recently approved by FDA given the significant improvement over placebo and even reduced systemic exposure compared with immediate-release triamcinolone (71) .",

Opioids may be divided in weak, such as codeine and tramadol, or strong, among which morphine, fentanyl and oxycodone and their analogous molecules are the most common (85) . In general, opioids should be administered with care since they may interfere with the innate and acquired immune response (86) , are associated with respiratory depression (87) , and increase the incidence and severity of infections of the airway's tracts, including pneumonia (88) . Moreover, opioid systems impair and modulate immune responses induced by the influenza virus that, on one hand, might be beneficial for controlling viral immunopathogenesis, but, on the other hand, may lead to delayed viral clearance (89) . Aware of these premises, individual molecules differ in their effect (90) . A group of them (i.e. morphine, fentanyl and remifentanil) was described as immunosuppressive (90) and their use associated to increased pneumonia incidence compared to molecules with no immunosuppressive activity (88, 91) . Also, weak opioids were associated with a reduced risk of Notably, considering the different administration routes, no differences in the overall adverse event profile emerged between transdermal opiates and oral treatments (94) .

Currently, no DMOADs have been licensed for use in the treatment of OA but several putative DMOADs are in phase II development. In particular, mAbs and inhibitors directed against OA-related cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) (106) (107) (108) (109) , nerve growth factor (NGF) (110) (111) (112) or interleukin molecules like IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2 (113) (114) (115) , are under investigation, due to their regular use as biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) for the management of rheumatoid arthritis inflammation (116) . In a report comparing safety outcomes of bDMARDs in rheumatoid arthritis in 42 observational studies, general safety profile of bDMARDs emerged with very sporadic cases of cardiovascular and infection incidence (117). Moreover, in a study aimed at evaluating the incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) in a group of patients suffering from chronic inflammatory rheumatism and treated with bDMARDs, ILI resulted higher than the value reported in the general population, although no important complications or hospitalizations have been reported (118) . Similarly, very low rate or absence of adverse events was observed for tested DMOADs, like TNF\u03b1 (119-121), NGF (111, 112) and IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2 (114, 115, 122) inhibitors, suggesting an overall safety profile.",

Similarly to other SARS-CoV, also COVID-19 triggers inflammasome activation, especially within lymphoid cells, and patients have increased serum IL-1\u03b2 (127) . Consistently, a Chinese study demonstrated that inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 might be a beneficial strategy for the treatment of SARS infections (128) . Further, a phase III RCT of IL-1\u03b2 blockade in sepsis showed significant survival benefit in patients with hyperinflammation (129) . Nevertheless, at present, there is no evidence for IL-1\u03b2 blockers in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The literature, however, did suggest a potential role for the reduction of pro-inflammatory markers, such as IL-1\u03b2, which are elevated as part of the immune response and may have a role in the severe lung damage associated with human coronaviruses. Under the same paradigm, IL-6 proinflammatory cytokine is under investigation as target for COVID-19 therapy, particularly in patients developing ARDS with severe hyperinflammatory response characterized by high increases of plasma IL-6 and CRP levels. In very preliminary results of a recent report, IL-6 blocker Tocilizumab appeared to be an effective treatment option in COVID-19 patients, although used in combination with glucocorticoids (29) . In conclusion, in the COVID-19 patients with concomitant OA, for which traditional treatments still have a wider and documented consistency and safety, more data about mAbs efficacy/safety and the completion of DMOADs Phase II studies will lay the foundation for the use of these cutting edge and possibly safer therapeutics as first line option in the near future, when the pandemic is expected to remain a threat.

The introduction of some mAbs in compassionate use for COVID-19 patients showed encouraging results, which can indicate the real consistence with this previously mentioned hypothesis, but, again, this still needs to be studied and confirmed by large epidemiological studies. In this view, we underline the crucial role of the orthopaedic registries as an effective collection of evidences in this prominent field.",

            "text": "To face the pandemic at present times, on a daily basis clinicians decide the first-line pharmacological therapy, whether or not discontinue an existing therapy, and the efficacious alternative when the previous approach fails. Both patients' characteristics (comorbidities) and previous treatments' iatrogenic effects are essential to drive these decisions and reflect perceived differences in safety across drugs for incidence and complications. The currently available data indicate that OA therapies are safe and there is not any clear indication to avoid prescription or suggest discontinuation of existing pharmacological therapies due to Covid-19 infection incidence or complications. Nevertheless, we are convinced that particular attention should be used for OA patients, especially if hospitalized. In our opinion, specialists and clinicians should carefully consider each single patient profile and balance the cost/benefit ratio of current or new therapies (Table I and Figure 1 ). Often, anti-inflammatory and anti-pain drugs are prescribed for weak to moderate symptoms caused by everyday life movements that are largely reduced, if not absent, during home isolation or hospitalization. Therefore, drugs reported to have the strongest supposed influence on secondary infections or complications should be prescribed only when benefits overcome the potential harm. In this frame, another crucial and still largely underestimate factor for the choice of the most appropriate therapy and its continuation/discontinuation is the stage of the COVID-19 infection (Figure 1 ). In absence of symptoms or in the early/middle stage, especially in younger patients with absence of relevant comorbidities, continuation of OA therapies is strongly recommended since approximately 80% of affected individuals will end in this stage without complications leading to hospitalization/intensive care. In the mild/late phase of infection, characterized by a state of high levels of inflammation leading to further clinical deterioration and potential involvement of extrapulmonary sites, the cost/benefit ratio of OA therapies has to be evaluated with care, especially for CS or strong/immunosuppressive opioids. In general, with a few exceptions that deserve cost/benefit considerations, OA patients should be reassured to continue their treatment even during COVID-19 outbreak. This would prevent disease flares that can contribute to increase patient burden, disability, poor quality of life, and healthcare",

Overall, paracetamol might be a better option in case of pneumonia due to NSAIDs detrimental consequence of delaying antibiotic therapy and bronchoconstriction, possibly leading to NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD) phenotype that, when diagnosed, results in NSAIDs discontinuation(62).For respiratory tract viral infections, in a mouse study it was reported that paracetamol reduces the morbidity associated with Influenza A infection by decreasing the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the airway spaces and improving the overall lung function(63). In a Cochrane Review, paracetamol helped relieve nasal obstruction and rhinorrhoea but did not appear to improve sore throat, malaise, sneezing and cough in people with cold, the most frequent viral infection of the upper respiratory tract(64).In conclusion, in the COVID19 frame, at present there are no evidences in favour or against the use or a higher safety profile of paracetamol vs NSAIDs during the treatment of patients. Surely, those already taking paracetamol should not discontinue its use, although it should be taken into account that, likewise NSAIDs and other antipyretic substances, paracetamol does not increase infectious risk ratio but can be responsible of a later presentation of symptoms or an underestimation of the severity of the disease, both leading to a delayed diagnosis, possible worse prognosis and life threatening complications.(Table I andFigure 1)",

Overall, the recent guidelines from the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America advise against adjunctive CS treatment of pneumonia or influenza pneumonia except in patients who have other indications for their use (81). Eventually, in April 2020 the first report on COVID-19 patients treated with CS after infection was released (82). Eleven patients out of 31 received CS, and no association was indicated between CS treatment and virus clearance time (hazard ratio of 1.26 [0.58-2.74]), hospital length of stay (0.77 [0.33-1.78]), or duration of symptoms (0.86 [0.40-1.83]). Therefore, again, no clinical data exist at the moment suggest that net benefit or detriment is derived from CS in COVID-19 patients. Some light for future research and eventual indication of CS use for COVID-19 might be related to their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, since the most obvious detrimental outcomes on the immune system might be balanced by the reduction of the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 progression. At present, in absence of clear indications, in the last update of WHO guidelines for patients suspected of COVID-19 infection, as for general or influenza pneumonia it is recommended to avoid routine CS use unless they are indicated for another reason (83). In this scenario, in OA patients already treated systemically with CS (84), there is no clear evidence suggesting the need of discontinuation, due to absence of clinical data connecting CS therapy and increased COVID-19 incidence.
