Growth factors, present in the serum, increased aminopeptidase N activity of dermal fibroblasts, in contrast with an increase in human mesangial cell aminopeptidase N upon serum withdrawal [10] . The fact that serum stimulatory factor was not dialysable and that its activity was suppressed by heating the serum at 100\u00b0C for 5 min before addition to the culture suggest that this factor is probably a protein or peptide. Fetal calf serum contains some growth factors which could influence aminopeptidase N expression. Previously, we identified in serum epidermal growth factor (EGF) and showed that aminopeptidase N is upregulated upon treatment of human mesangial cells with nanomolar concentrations of EGF [11] . Dermal fibroblast aminopeptidase N was unaffected following treatment with cAMP in the concentration range from 10 to 500 mM. This is different from mesangial cell aminopeptidase N, which was stimulated with cAMP and cAMPstimulating agents [10] . PMA treatment had no effect on dermal fibroblast aminopeptidase N; however, it caused marked induction of the enzyme in glomerular mesangial and epithelial cells [9, 12] .

Dexamethasone treatment was found to induce dermal fibroblast aminopeptidase N. This effect was time-and dose-dependent. The increase in aminopeptidase N was inhibited by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, suggesting that enzyme protein synthesis is responsible for the increased activity. RU 38486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, prevented the increase in aminopeptidase N activity, showing that induction of aminopeptidase N is glucocorticoid receptor-mediated. The effect of glucocorticoids is relatively specific, since only a few proteins were induced when protein profiles from dexamethasone-treated cells are analysed by gel electrophoresis [13] . Regulation of fibroblast aminopeptidase N by cytokines was not extensively studied. Interleukin 4 (IL-4) increased both expression and functional activity of human dermal fibroblast aminopeptidase N [14] . IL-1 had no effect on fibroblast aminopeptidase N (Stefanovi\u0107 et al., unpublished observations). Other cytokines tested (tumour necrosis factor h and platelet-derived growth factor) were found to have no effect on expression of aminopeptidase N in fibroblasts [14] . The physiological role of surface aminopeptidase N in human dermal fibroblasts has not been established. Due to its broad substrate specificity aminopeptidase N cleaves various peptides, leading to activation or inactivation of certain biologically active peptides. Aminopeptidase N is thought to participate in the degradation of neuropeptides, such as enkephalins, endorphins and opioid peptides [5] . Apart from their degradative role, the second major property of cell surface proteases is their role as signal-transducing molecules. They transfer information into cells by acting as coreceptors along with more traditional receptors. In glomerular mesangial cells aminopeptidase N is a receptor for angiotensin IV [15] .
