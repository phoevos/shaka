Many cases have been found to display significant hematologic and thrombotic complications. The hematologic derangements are not insignificant, with increased risk for coagulation dysregulation and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [2] [3] [4] . Exacerbations of immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) are common in patients with viral syndromes. However, ITP exacerbation in the context of COVID-19 infection is a rare, but increasingly recognized phenomenon [5] . Here, we provide a unique case of ITP, suggestive due to COVID-19 infection. This case illustrates the tenants of thrombocytopenia evaluation in addition to management in rare cases such as this.",

Symptoms began the day prior to admission. She reported symptoms of fatigue, body aches, rhinorrhea, and a fever of 101\u00b0F while at home. She also reported a cough. Of note, the patient had traveled outside of the state the week prior to admission. Her husband had recently been sick with pneumonia and she was caring for him while at home. However, his COVID status was unknown. Initial exam was remarkable for a pleasant female who appeared clinically ill with stable vital signs and without clinical stigmata of severe thrombocytopenia. Complete blood count was obtained and showed hemoglobin of 10.5 gm/dL and undetectable platelets at < 3 K/\u00b5L. White blood cell count was found depressed at 4.1 K/\u00b5L with a depressed absolute lymph count of 0.60 K/\u00b5L. Cell counts reviewed from the year prior were within normal limits. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was found elevated at 299 U/L. ADAMTS13 activity was found > 100% (reference range > 70%). Ferritin level was also elevated at 441 ng/mL. Additional work-up included vitamin B12 of 718 pg/mL and serum folate 22.3 ng/mL (reference range > 3.9 ng/mL). The patient was tested for COVID-19 via nasopharyngeal swab, which returned positive. Initial chest radiography was negative for any acute cardiopulmonary process. Blood cultures were obtained but remained no growth throughout admission.",

A QTc of 375 ms was noted on the electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to initiating hydroxychloroquine. The patient responded well to the IVIG administration with an increase in platelet count to 105 K/\u00b5L on day 3 of admission. Despite initial management as described above, diarrhea and abdominal discomfort continued. Work-up included negative Clostridium difficile, giardia, Cryptosporidium, and rotavirus testing. The patient was started on an anti-diarrhea regimen (Lomotil\u00ae with PRN Imodium\u00ae). Respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms resolved by day 4 of hospital admission. On the day of discharge, platelet count had increased to 146 K/\u00b5L. Twenty-eight days after discharge, she presented to hematology clinic with a platelet count of 8 K/\u00b5L. Repeat nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID testing was negative and she was treated with IVIG and pulse dexamethasone with prompt response, confirming suspicion of underlying, undiagnosed ITP prior to COVID infection.",

A wide range in clinical presentation exist, ranging from mild symptoms to sepsis and death. A severe form of pneumonia is not an uncommon occurrence and is estimated to occur in up to 10%-15% of patients [7] . The hematologic manifestations of COVID-19 have emerged as a particularly important issue, as patients have been found to have clinical and laboratory findings which include thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer, prolonged prothrombin time, and DIC [2] .

ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion in the evaluation of thrombocytopenia. While the pathogenesis is incompletely understood, the prevailing theory is that viral antigens cross-react with normal platelet antigens in a form of molecular mimicry causing platelet destruction. Some of the more common viruses that cause this phenomenon include varicellazoster virus (VZV), HIV, hepatitis C, and cytomegalovirus [9] [10] [11] [12] . It is possible that a similar mechanism exists with COVID-19, or COVID-19 may precipitate an exacerbation of preceding low-grade ITP disorder. One of the limitations of our report is the patient did not undergo testing for HIV or hepatitis, albeit clinical suspicion was low due the presence of an alternative viral etiology.
