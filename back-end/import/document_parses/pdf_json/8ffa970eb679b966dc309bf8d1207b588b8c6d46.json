Enhanced tumor necrosis factor alpha in coronavirus but not in paracetamolinduced acute hepatic necrosis in mice. Liver 1992; 12: 205-208. Abstract: Previous reports have demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatic necrosis. The purpose of this experimental study was to measure TNF-a blood activity in paracetamol-induced liver necrosis and in coronavirus (MHV3)-induced fulminant hepatitis in mice. No elevation of TNF-a activity was found in hepatic failure complicating paracetamol poisoning. In contrast, TNF-a activity significantly increased in response to MHV3, reaching 16.3f5.5 U/ml from 24 h post infection (P<O.Ol). This augmentation was observed even though the virus was not detectable in the liver. Serum alanine aminotransferase levels were low and no histological lesion was observed. In conclusion, our study further supports the implication of TNF-a in virus-induced hepatitis failure and confirms that paracetamol poisoning does not cause increased TNF-cr activity in the circulation.",

We used paracetamol and the murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV3) to induce acute liver necrosis. Paracetamol is a classic hepatotoxic agent in both humans and mice, and the mechanism for liver injury is well known (5, 6) . Swiss mice are susceptible to acute infection by MHV3 and die of fulminant hepatitis within 3 or 4 days (7) . Swiss mice (10-12 weeks old) were purchased from the Centre de selection et d'elevage d'animaux de laboratoire, Orleans, France. MHV3 was plaquepurified in L cells as previously described (8) . Stock virus was obtained by inoculation of L cell monolayers with MHV3. Aliquots of stock virus were stored at -80\u00b0C in Eagle mihimal essential medium (MEM) before use.

On microscopic examination, small discrete foci of necrosis associated with sparse polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltrate without topographical predominance were observed from the first day post Discussion A number of experimental studies have demonstrated that TNF-a is implicated in the pathophysiology of fulminant liver necrosis (1,2, 10, 1 1). Tiegs et al. reported that intravenous injection of murine recombinant TNF-a to mice induced fulminant hepatitis when animals had been sensitized 1 h before by intraperitoneal administration of galactosamine (1). These data confirmed previous studies in which fulminant hepatitis was induced by intravenous injection of human recombinant TNF-cr in galactosamine-sensitized mice (1 1). More recently, Sinclair et al. reported an elevation of TNF-cr production by peritoneal macrophages from susceptible mice infected with MHV3 (2). Moreover, some clinical studies have suggested a relationship between TNF-a production and the cause of liver injury (3, 4) . TNF-cr production by blood mononuclear cells from patients with fulminant hepatic failure was increased in virally-induced fulminant hepatitis but not in paracetamol-induced liver failure (4). All these reports have provided evidence that TNF-cr played a prominent role in the pathophysiology of fulminant liver necrosis.",

In this animal model, a significant increase of ALT and marked histological lesions were not obvious before 4 h post intoxication. The elevated level of ALT observed at 6 and 12 h post intoxication was related to liver necrosis recorded by microscopic examination. The delay in ALT elevation and in histological necrosis could be related to the time needed for hepatic depletion of glutathione reserves (5, 12). However, these findings do not exclude a participation of TNF-cr in the pathogenesis of liver necrosis since serum TNF-cr activity may not reflect the local production of TNF-cr. Furthermore, TNF-a biological activity may also be inhibited by the presence of TNF-a inhibitors (13) . Further studies including local TNF-cr gene expression should be performed to test these hypotheses.",

This augmentation is observed from 12 h post infection, even though the virus or viral antigens were not detectable in the liver by either titration or immunohistochemistry. This early increase in circulating TNF-a could be related to the systemic response to the viral infection or may be due to the immune reaction of the peritoneal macrophages to MHV3. This hypothesis is consistent with the studies of Sinclair et a]. who reported a marked increase of specific mediators including TNF-a, leukotrienes and interleukine-1 by peritoneal macrophages in response to MHV3 (2). However, the precise role of TNF-a and other cytokines in the pathogenesis of virally-induced fulminant hepatitis remains unclear. TNF-a is known to activate the coagulation system and to promote the adhesion of neutrophils to vascular endothelium, a prominent feature of murine hepatitis virus infection (14) . TNF-a is also known to control the production of leukotrienes which are strongly involved in the pathogenesis of experimental fulminant hepatitis (2, 15, 16) . Inhibition of TNF-a and leukotrienes production with dimethylprostaglandin E2 prevents MHV3-induced fulminant hepatitis without altering viral replication. These data provide evidence that macrophage activation with subsequent production of inflammatory mediators including TNF-a appears to be a key factor in the pathogenesis of MHV3-induced fulminant hepatitis.",
