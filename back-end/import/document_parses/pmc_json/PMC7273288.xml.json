Clinical experience thus far has demonstrated significant heterogeneity in the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 infection, spanning patients who are asymptomatic to those with mild, moderate, and severe disease forms, with a high percentage of patients who do not survive(2, 3). Notably, it can be difficult to accurately predict clinical outcomes for patients across this spectrum of clinical presentations. This presents an enormous challenge to the prognostication and management of COVID-19 patients, especially within disease epicenters such as New York City (NYC) that need to triage a high volume of patients. Accurate prediction of COVID-19 mortality, and the identification of contributing factors would therefore allow for targeted strategies in patients with the highest risk of death.",

Although we were able to develop accurate predictors from these limited data using our machine learning framework, it should be possible to develop even better predictors using a richer set of features. A key limitation of clinical indices included in the datasets include the uniformity of Electronic Medical Record (EMR)-derived data. For example, while minimum oxygen saturation during the health encounter was identified as a significant predictor for mortality, limitations inherent in the interpretation of this data must be noted, such as the unavailability of the amount of supplemental oxygen being administered at the time of recording and acquisition-related limitations, such as readings below the threshold of accuracy of the monitoring device (e.g. less than 70%). Nonetheless, we found a clearly lower distribution of minimum oxygen saturations in those patients who died from COVID-19 compared to those who survived, highlighting this clinical feature as central to predicting morality for infected patients.",

At each level, four candidate classifiers (LR, RF, SVM and XGBoost) were trained and evaluated on the corresponding holdout set in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC score) as the metric. This process was repeated 100 times and the average AUCs for each candidate classifier and missing value level are shown here, along with error bars denoted by vertical arrows. (B) Using a setup analogous to (A), and the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm, we evaluated the performance of the four classification algorithms with different number of features selected from the full set of twenty.
