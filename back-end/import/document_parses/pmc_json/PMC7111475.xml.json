Compared with unstimulated control cells, IFN-\u03b2 levels were decreased in cultured normal epithelial cells treated with IL-4 or IL-13 (Fig 2\n, A and B). OAS levels were downregulated in cells incubated with IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-\u03b1, and TGF-\u03b2, whereas IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bb2 levels showed no change (Fig 2, C-H).

Cultured epithelial cells from normal sinus mucosal tissue of control subjects and inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue of patients with CRSwNP and those with CRSsNP were treated with various concentrations of clarithromycin or azithromycin, and cell viability was assessed by using the MTT assay. The macrolide concentrations used did not affect cell viability (data not shown). After stimulation with macrolides for 24 hours, levels of antiviral factors were measured by using real-time PCR, ELISA, and Western blotting (Figs 3 and 4\n). mRNA and protein levels of IFN-\u03b2 were upregulated, both in normal epithelial cells and in inflammatory epithelial cells differentiated from patients with CRSsNP who were treated with 1, 10, or 50 \u03bcmol/L clarithromycin (Fig 3, A and B). However, IFN-\u03b2 levels in inflammatory epithelial cells from patients with noneosinophilic and those with eosinophilic CRSwNP increased at 1 and 10 \u03bcmol/L clarithromycin treatment (Fig 3, A and B). Levels of IFN-\u03bb1 were upregulated in normal epithelial cells treated with 1, 10, or 50 \u03bcmol/L clarithromycin; for inflammatory epithelial cells from patients with CRSsNP, IFN-\u03bb1 levels increased with 10 and 50 \u03bcmol/L clarithromycin treatment, whereas inflammatory epithelial cells from patients with CRSwNP showed IFN-\u03bb1 upregulation with 10 \u03bcmol/L clarithromycin treatment (Fig 3, C and D). Thus clarithromycin-treated cells exhibited differential increases in levels of antiviral factors compared with nontreated cells (Fig 3), depending on the type of cultured epithelial cells (normal or inflammatory), type of antiviral factors, or clarithromycin concentration. Similar findings were observed in epithelial cells treated with azithromycin (Fig 4).",

The lower detection rate was likely due to samples collected from patients with stable CRS without exacerbated symptoms. Therefore further studies are required to evaluate whether viral infections are responsible for acute exacerbations in CRS symptoms. Nevertheless, expression of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb1, and IFN-\u03bb2 and ISGs was detected in both normal and inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue of all healthy control subjects and patients with CRS enrolled in the present study, despite the low viral detection rate.",

To assess this, we analyzed expression levels of ISGs and type I (IFN-\u03b2) and type III (IFN-\u03bb) interferons in sinus mucosal tissue and found that levels of these antiviral factors were lower in sinus mucosal tissue from patients with CRS than those in healthy sinus mucosal tissue. These data agree with results showing that defective IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb production in the bronchial airway epithelium contributes to impairment of viral control in asthmatic patients and patients with COPD.31, 32, 34 Collectively, these data imply that low levels of these antiviral factors in inflammatory sinus epithelium might result in a deficient innate immune response to VRI in patients with CRS; furthermore, greater expression of antiviral factors in the sinonasal epithelium might protect against VRI-induced CRS exacerbation. This interpretation is supported by recent clinical trial data showing that IFN-\u03b2 inhalation can effectively prevent virus\u2013induced asthma exacerbations.16, 51, 52 On the other hand, patients with chronic eosinophilic CRSwNP is associated with AERD, which is characterized by the presence of a peculiar mixed IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 inflammatory milieu with prominent expression of IFN-\u03b3.22, 53, 54 These observations suggest that these mixed patterns might be responsible for altered regulation of the COX pathway.55, 56 Although the association between viral infection and AERD has been reported in a few published studies, influenza viruses are known to use the COX-2/prostaglandin E2 signaling pathway for their benefit.57, 58, 59 Taken together, these studies suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and pharmacologic inhibitors against COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes can be used as therapeutic drugs for viral infection.60\n",

Although the mechanism of the antiviral effect of macrolides has not been determined, clarithromycin was suggested to mediate the antiviral effects through decreased intercellular adhesion molecule 1, IL-6, and IL-8 production.65 Azithromycin upregulates antiviral substrate interferons, preventing virus-induced episodes.66 Azithromycin antiviral activity in bronchial cells from patients with cystic fibrosis was also associated with stimulation of antiviral mechanisms through increased expression of interferons and ISGs.67 These results suggest that azithromycin pretreatment reduces rhinovirus replication, possibly by amplifying the interferon-mediated antiviral response. In this study both clarithromycin and azithromycin upregulated the levels of antiviral factors, including interferons, in cultured normal and inflammatory epithelial cells from healthy control subjects, patients with CRSwNP, or patients with CRSsNP, respectively. Consequently, clarithromycin and azithromycin might be useful as interferon inducers for treating virus-associated CRS exacerbation. In contrast, telithromycin, a 16-membered macrolide, did not reduce rhinoviral replication.68 Therefore expression of antiviral factors might be induced differently, depending on the types of macrolides.",

In contrast, Thomas et al71 demonstrated that glucocorticoid treatment increases viral replication in pulmonary bronchial epithelial cells without a significant reduction of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03bb levels both in vitro and in vivo. However, Bochkov et al72 found that the glucocorticoid budesonide did not affect rhinovirus replication or interferon production in vitro, suggesting that the effect of glucocorticoids on viral infection might vary depending on the cell type and experimental environments. Further research is required to solve these issues.",

These data suggest that the roles of TLR3 and TLR7 in interferon induction are not impaired in inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue. However, TLR3 stimulation with poly (I:C) led to upregulation of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2, and ISGs in cultured normal and inflammatory epithelial cells, whereas R848-treated cells showed no interferon response. These data highlight that inflammatory epithelial cells might have the capacity to produce interferons and ISGs by activating TLR3 and suggest that the interferon response in patients with CRS might mediate host defenses, inhibiting virus-induced exacerbations.",

Nevertheless, macrolides and glucocorticoids can provide positive effects on the treatment of CRS by upregulating interferon and ISG levels.Clinical implicationsInterferon and ISG levels are decreased in patients with CRS. Interferon and ISG levels in cultured cells were increased after treatment with macrolides or dexamethasone, providing their possible role in effective prevention of virus-induced CRS exacerbation.\n",
