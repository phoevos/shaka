Though the majority of patients undergo an uneventful recovery, in around 19% there is a progressive worsening leading to severe pneumonia in 14% and critical pneumonia in 5% of patients [1]. There is a staged progression in the course of events after a median incubation period of 4 days (interquartile range 2\u20137 days) [2]. The adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) usually develops from the second week onwards. This does not only happen because of uncontrolled viral replication but also because of an explosive immune response from the host. In presence of uncontrolled viral replication, the presence of an increased number of infected epithelial cells and cell debris triggers a massive cytokine release - the so-called \u2018cytokine storm\u2019 - with hyperinflammation and immune suppression, characterized by decreased memory CD4 + T helper cells and increased CD8 cytotoxic activity [3].",

At one end of the spectrum, a balanced immune response keeps the infection under control, but at the other end there is an exaggerated immune response with consequent lung injury. Lung injury initiates at the epithelial-interstitial-endothelial level, with exudation of neutrophils and macrophages, which, in its turn reduces the alveolar surfactant, thereby reducing the alveolar patency and the gas exchange. Infected cellular debris further augments the release of inflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6, further accentuating the \u2018cytokine storm\u201d [4].",

At this stage, patients exhibit lymphopenia with reduced B cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells and CD16+ Natural Killer (NK) cells. This probably results because of an increase in extravasations of dysfunctional lymphocytes [5]. The accompanying \u201ccytokine storm\u201d leads to a massive vascular inflammation, disseminated coagulation, shock and hypotension, leading to multi organ failure and death. Fig. 1\nbriefly summarizes the pathogenesis of ARDS in COVID-19.

It is with this pathophysiology in mind that intervention with corticosteroids has been thought about in COVID-19.",

            "text": "Since corticosteroids causes immune suppression by impairing the innate immunity, their use has been largely discouraged because of the fear of worsening of viral propagation. However, in patients who are on long term maintenance dose of steroids, there is no increased incidence of development of severe or critical pneumonia in presence of COVID-19 [6]. Interestingly, most of earlier studies done in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) showed adverse outcomes with corticosteroid treatment [7,8]. Indeed, two recent commentaries published in the Lancet reported that corticosteroids should be avoided for the treatment of COVID-19 [9,10]. However, these assumptions are mainly based on the experiences in similar viral illness but not on COVID-19 specifically. Both Word Health Organization (WHO) and The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USA also specifically advises against the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 for the purpose of immune modulation [11,12]. In contrast, the recent multinational Surviving Sepsis Guideline in COVID-19, recommends giving steroids in patients with severe COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation with ARDS, in order to reduce the destructive inflammatory immune response (based on very minimal evidence though), and to treat suspected adrenal insufficiency associated with sepsis, particularly in those with refractory shock, although this guideline advises against the use of corticosteroids in COVID patients in non-ARDS respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation [13]. Nevertheless, the Randomized Evaluation of COVid-19 thERapY (RECOVERY Trial) conducted in patients with COVID-19 has shown a significantly improved the outcome with dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, in the treatment of severe COVID-19 requiring oxygen therapy or on mechanical ventilator [14]. These finding prompted us to conduct a systematic review of studies conducted with corticosteroid in patients with COVID-19 as well as ARDS due to other viral diseases.",

            "text": "The role of corticosteroids in non-COVID ARDS remains controversial. In a multicentric randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in 2018 involving 17 intensive care units (ICUs) in Spain, the role of dexamethasone in established ARDS of mixed non-COVID etiology was evaluated with 277 patients, of whom 139 were randomly assigned to the dexamethasone group, while the rest served as the controls. Mean number of ventilation free days (at 28 days) was more in the dexamethasone group in comparison with the control group (12.3 days vs. 7.5 days, p < 0.001), with a 15.3% reduction of all-cause mortality on day 60 (21% vs. 36%, p = 0.005), 12.5% reduction of ICU mortality (19% vs. 31%, p = 0.017) and a 12.5% reduction of hospital mortality (24% vs. 36%, p = 0.024). An encouraging fact of this study was that there was no significant increased incidence of hyperglycemia, new onset infections or barotrauma [15]. These results suggest that early therapy with dexamethasone could change the outcome of ARDS by having an effect on the systemic immune responses. The effect on reduced requirement of ventilation is actually a manifestation of better survival. In ARDS, down regulation of the pulmonary and systemic inflammation with long term dexamethasone leads to a substantial improvement in indices of alveolar\u2013capillary membrane permeability and tissue repair [16].",

Two studies of patients with SARS-CoV-1 and influenza A (H1N1) viral pneumonia showed that the use of systemic corticosteroids was associated with reduced mortality in critical patients [6,17]. However, a meta-analysis showed a considerable higher mortality (Risk ratio [RR] 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30\u20132.36; p = 0.0002) and higher rate of secondary infection (RR 1.98; 95% CI, 1.04\u20133.78; p = 0.04) in steroid treated influenza patients [18]. Methylprednisolone was used in a significant number of studies followed by hydrocortisone, prednisolone and dexamethasone. In MERS-CoV, steroid treatment was associated with an adverse outcome with higher 90-day crude mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.87; 95% CI, 1.02\u20133.44; P = 0.04), higher likelihood of invasive ventilation (93.4 vs. 76.6%; p < 0.0001) and delayed viral clearance (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.35; 95% CI 0.17\u20130.72; p = 0.005), though it has to be borne in mind that the steroid used was mostly hydrocortisone in 68% [8]. Notwithstanding a lack of uniform protocol in SARS-CoV-1, methylprednisolone, particularly when used in high dosage (up to 1000 mg/day) did show some survival benefit and some degree of reduction in incidence of ARDS and early discharge from the hospital [17,19,20]. Altogether systemic corticosteroids were used in 79.6% of SARS-CoV-1 and 48.9% of MERS-CoV critical cases [8,17]. However, most of these studies had minimal follow up and do not record about the long-term consequences of high dose steroid including the prevalence of relative adrenal insufficiency or unmasking of diabetes [17]. One study showed incidence of avascular necrosis of hip in China as 3.2% (4 of 124 cases) [20], much lower than other studies [21,22], which again was presumably secondary to the lower dose of steroids used in former. Another issue was the timing of the steroids and other treatments used. Early use of steroids in some studies along with antiviral and broad-spectrum antibiotics showed the best result in SARS-CoV-1 but not in MERS-CoV infections [17,20]. Table 1\nsummarizes the results of studies conducted in patients with previous coronavirus infections.",

All these trials included patients with severe and critical COVID-19 patients with pulmonary involvement. Of the 5 studies (4 retrospective and 1 quasi-prospective study) conducted with corticosteroids, 3 studies have shown a benefit, while 2 studies shown no benefit, and there was a suggestion of significant harm especially in the critical cases in one sub-study (propensity-matched adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.90; 95% CI, 1.17\u20137.16; p = 0.021) [[28], [29], [30], [31], [32]]. A common pattern evolving from these retrospective trials suggests more benefit with low dose steroids compared to the high dose steroids. Moreover, judicious use of corticosteroids has been shown to improve several parameters of severe and critical COVID-19, including reduction of duration of hospital stay, prevention of worsening of the ventilator parameters, progression to ARDS, and death [30], quicker normalization of pyrexia and improvement in the status of oxygenation [31], reduced incidence of intubation and subsequent ventilation [32]. It should be noted that none of these retrospective and quasi-prospective trials evaluated the data in patients with mild COVID-19 and majority of the patients were receiving other repurposed drugs beside the absence of controlled arm.",

Evaluation at 28-days found a significant reduction in mortality by 35% amongst the invasive mechanical ventilation patients (29.0% vs. 40.7%; RR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48\u20130.88; p = 0.003) and by 20% among the patients on supplemental oxygen therapy with or without noninvasive ventilation (21.5% vs. 25.0%; RR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67\u20130.96; p = 0.0021), although no benefit was observed in mild or moderate cases, not requiring oxygen support (17.0% vs.13.2%; RR 1.22; 95% CI, 0.93\u20131.61; p = 0.14). This is significant in view of the fact that the overall COVID-19 mortality in UK is >26% and >37% patients require invasive ventilation. Secondary outcome of the study showed shorter duration of hospitalization with dexamethasone compared to standard of care (median 12 days vs. 13 days) and a 11% higher probability of discharge within 28 days (RR 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04\u20131.19; p = 0.002).

            "text": "A potential sequelae of corticosteroid therapy is the worsening of dysglycemia/unmasking of latent diabetes. Corticosteroids produce increased lipolysis, increased hepatic glucose output and can increase the insulin resistance by up to 60\u201380% by directly interfering with the signaling cascade of the GLUT-4 receptors. This leads to a 30\u201350% reduction of insulin stimulated glucose uptake of the skeletal muscle cells, contributing to a postprandial hyperglycemia, as well as a 50\u201370% reduction of hepatic glycogenesis. Corticosteroids also produce breakdown of proteins and the resultant surge in amino acids also interferes with the insulin signaling of the muscle cells. Corticosteroids also have a direct inhibitory action on \u03b2 cells. Lipotoxicity from the lipolysis can also have a similar effect on the \u03b2 cells [49,50]. The effects of steroids are usually transient and reversible with the stoppage of the steroids. Of the corticosteroids used in COVID-19, methylprednisolone is a short/intermediate acting glucocorticoid of 4\u20136 h duration, while dexamethasone is a long acting steroid with steroid induced hyperglycemia lasting for more than 24 h after the last dose, with a minimal fall after an overnight fast. Recent data suggests that the impact is maximum when steroid is administered acutely, but a spontaneous remission usually happens [51]. With a short course of steroids in most of the COVID-19 trials (10-days of dexamethasone in RECOVERY, 3\u20137 days by other trials with methylprednisolone), it is less likely that steroid induced hyperglycemia or worsening of glycemic control in preexisting diabetes contributed in any significant way given the fact that in RECOVERY trial both dexamethasone and usual care arm had equal percentage (nearly 25%) of patients with diabetes. Nevertheless, all treating physician must be careful about the expected worsening of hyperglycemia with the use of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 and should take all corrective measures to tackle it.",
