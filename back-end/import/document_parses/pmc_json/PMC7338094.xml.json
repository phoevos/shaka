Studies demonstrated that the bronchial artery is the main feeding artery for lung tumours. Hence, bronchial artery infusion is used as a palliative treatment option for primary and metastatic lung cancers [6]. Additionally, transcatheter therapy for purposes other than tumour management was reported. Transcatheter arterial steroid injection therapy prevented the progression of severe acute hepatic failure to a fatal stage of fulminant liver failure in 13 out of 17 patients [7].",

Furthermore, the blood flow into the lung in cases of pneumonia might be reduced as reported before in experimental animals [8]. The other major obstacle is how to prepare the angiographic suite for COVID-19 to control the spread of infection to the intervention radiology staff and other patients. Ierardi et al. [9] reported strict preprocedural, intraprocedural, and postprocedural workflow measures in the setting of an IR unit that is highly exposed to COVID-19. These safe practices may raise the equipment cost, prolong procedural times, and increase technical difficulties.",
