            "text": "Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) is one of the most neglected tropical diseases. Millions of people are infected with T. cruzi in Latin America. Moreover, it has spread to non-endemic countries as consequence of people migration, representing a new global health problem. Chagas disease presents two clinical phases with a broad range of symptomatology, and can even be lethal in both phases (Coura and Borges-Pereira, 2010, Nunes et al., 2013, Ramirez et al., 2013). Host resistance during T. cruzi infection is dependent on a rapid induction of a Th1 inflammatory response, which could be promptly balanced by diverse immuno-endocrine regulatory mechanisms that prevent the pathology mediated by inflammation and facilitate the survival (Roggero et al., 2006, Savino et al., 2007). Among counterregulatory mechanisms, different players have been implicated, such as anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) and endogenous glucocorticoids (Dutra et al., 2014, Roggero et al., 2009, Sathler-Avelar et al., 2009). In the case of Chagas\u2019 disease, the role of Treg cells remains controversial (de Araujo et al., 2011, Kotner and Tarleton, 2007, Mariano et al., 2008). Studies in asymptomatic patients with chronic T. cruzi infection show that, compared to symptomatic ones, they have increased Treg cell frequencies (de Araujo et al., 2011, Sathler-Avelar et al., 2009), suggesting a role for Treg cells in the control of immunopathology. In contrast, in mouse models of acute T. cruzi infection Treg cells were found to play a limited role in the control of the parasite-associated inflammation and immunopathology (Kotner and Tarleton, 2007, Sales et al., 2008). These findings implied that regulatory mechanisms might be overcome by the effector response, probably by the exposure to stimulatory signals that favors T effector (Teff) cell development.",

IL-2 signalling is essential for the clonal expansion, functional activity and for eliciting proper Teff cell memory responses (Bachmann et al., 2007). Nevertheless, IL-2 also plays a major role in the peripheral survival and suppressive function of Treg cells (Malek and Bayer, 2004). Noteworthy, autoimmunity and protective immunity develops in the absence of IL-2R signalling, indicating a more essential role of IL-2 for Treg than Teff cells (Malek, 2003). Indeed, Treg cells require only a very low IL-2/IL-2R signalling threshold to support their development and peripheral homeostasis (Yu et al., 2009). This key point is the basis of the development of Treg-targeted therapy by low dose IL-2 administration (Matsuoka et al., 2013).",

This implies a certain degree of plasticity of Treg cells, since they can express transcription factors and cytokines that are not classical for this population, without losing their suppressor activity (Hall et al., 2013). In particular, Th1-like Treg cells can express IFN-\u03b3 and T-bet and seem to be involved in the suppression of Th1 inflammation (Oldenhove et al., 2009). Moreover, more recent studies indicate that the conversion of conventional Treg cells to Treg cells with a Th-effector phenotype might be associated with the downregulation of Foxp3 and the expression of specific cytokines (Zhou et al., 2009). The relevance of these Th1-like Treg cells in the context of infectious diseases still remains controversial. Probably they may exert a regulatory role dampening the exacerbated Th1 response (Oldenhove et al., 2009), or instead promoting a Th1-driven pathology (Zhou et al., 2009).",

Of note, we have previously reported comparative studies carried out between resistant BALB/c and susceptible C57BL/6 mice showing that corticosterone release coupled to the immune process is determinant in the course of T. cruzi infection. Accordingly, while BALB/c mice exhibited a rapid increase in corticosterone levels following infection and a controlled production of pro-inflammatory cytokines; no major changes were detected in corticosterone concentrations in C57BL/6 mice in the first week of infection, in clear association with an exacerbated production of TNF-\u03b1; phenomenon which clearly contributed to their higher mortality. Besides delayed, corticosterone response in C57BL/6 mice is evidently protective and contributes to prolong survival, since the blockade of glucocorticoid receptor and/or adrenalectomy triggering more exacerbated pro-inflammatory cytokine release and also results in a more reduced survival time (Perez et al., 2007, Roggero et al., 2006). This evidence indicated that a subtle balance between endocrine responses and the concomitant immune response is necessary for an efficient defence against T. cruzi infection. Since glucocorticoids may also influence the control of an excessive immune response favoring the development of Treg cells (Barrat et al., 2002, Chen et al., 2006, Unger et al., 2009), we suspect that the delayed endocrine response observed in C57BL/6 mice during T. cruzi infection might be related with the Treg cells failed expansion.",

Here, we extend these studies during T. cruzi infection examining the dynamics of Treg and Teff cell interplay in this highly pro-inflammatory environment and examined the role of glucocorticoids on the Treg/Teff balance. We observed that the release of endogenous glucocorticoids occurring in response to T. cruzi-driven immune activation was crucial to sustain Treg homeostasis and the Treg/Teff balance. However, the lethal course of disease was associated with the acquisition of a pathogenic Th-1-like phenotype by Foxp3+ T cells and by a breakdown of the Treg cell response. Finally, treatment with a combination of IL-2 plus synthetic corticoid (Dexamethasone) induced Treg cell proliferation and the extinction of their Th1-like profile, which were significantly associated to increased survival.",

In this model, parasites can be detected in blood after \u223c7 days pi in some animals, reaching to a 100% of detection after 14 days pi, with their numbers progressively increasing until the death of the animals (Fig. 1\na). At day 21 pi, \u223c25% of mice survive and around 1 week later, mortality reaches 100% (Fig. 1b). We observed that the severity of T. cruzi infection was first linked to a rapid increase in serum IFN-\u03b3 levels and followed by a delayed systemic production of IL-10 (Fig. 1c). Histological studies carried out in the heart and muscle of infected mice revealed strong infiltrates of mononuclear cells, but a scarce occurrence of Foxp3+ cells (data nor shown). To evaluate whether the Treg and Teff cell responses were correlated with disease susceptibility and tissue damage, we first analyzed the frequency of both populations in spleen, dLN and blood along infection. Splenic Treg cell proportions gradually decreased along infection, reaching a 3-fold diminution after 21 days pi compared to basal levels (Fig. 1d). Similar results were observed in dLN and blood (data not shown). Noteworthy, a marked diminution in the Treg/Teff ratio was observed during the course of disease in spleen and blood (Fig. 1e). In the spleen, the decline of Treg/Teff ratio could be explained by the fact that T. cruzi infection results in an increase of Teff but not Treg cell absolute numbers, which remain quite constant along the infection (Fig. 1f). Thus, the striking diminution of the Treg/Teff ratio observed from day 14 pi associated with the scarce number of Treg cells in inflamed peripheral tissues suggests that after 2 weeks of infection Teff cells are unleashed from Treg cell control, likely governing the flared systemic inflammation that ultimately leads to mice death.",

            "text": "Of note, previous results from our group showed that glucocorticoid release accompanying T. cruzi-driven activation is indispensable to protect the host by impeding an excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Roggero et al., 2002, Perez et al., 2007). Since, at the same time, glucocorticoids may favor the development of Treg cells (Barrat et al., 2002, Chen et al., 2006, Unger et al., 2009), we evaluated in parallel both parameters along infection. As seen in Fig. 2\na, corticosterone secretion remained within physiological levels until day 14 pi, being followed by a substantial increase at days 17 and 21 pi; whereas the proportion of Treg cells continued to decrease. These data suggest that the delayed increase of the GC response observed during the first 2 weeks of infection may be related to the poor Treg cell expansion. Thus, to understand the role of endogenous corticosterone on Treg cell homeostasis during T. cruzi infection, C57BL/6 mice were subjected to bilateral adrenalectomy to deplete mice almost totally from the hormone, or sham surgery, 1 week before infection. Fig. 2b shows that in infected animals, adrenalectomy not only shortened mice survival (Fig. 2b) but also resulted in a diminished Treg/Teff ratio at day 14 pi in both spleen and dLNs compared to sham operated mice (Fig. 2c). The diminution of the Treg/Teff ratio was driven by a diminution in Treg cell frequency (i.e: spleen-14 days pi; infected sham mice = Tregs (%) 7.6 \u00b1 0.3; infected Adx mice = Tregs (%) 4.9 \u00b1 0.2; p\n < 0.05). Interestingly, in infected animals, Adx resulted in increased Teff cell numbers without changes in Treg cell numbers (Fig. 2d). These results indicate that during the two first weeks of T. cruzi infection, the relatively low levels of endogenous corticosterone secretion contribute to sustain the Treg/Teff balance.",

            "text": "The failure of Treg cells to keep up with Teff cell expansion during T. cruzi infection, as shown by their declined frequencies, may be related to a diminished proliferation and/or to increased cell death. To test these possibilities, we first compared the proliferation level of splenic Treg and Teff cells during infection. As shown in Fig. 3\n, after 14 and 19 days pi, the proportion of proliferating Ki-67+ Teff cells and also the proliferative index of Teff cells after 19 days pi were significantly increased during infection, compared to the small rise for Treg cells (n\n = 6/day; Fig. 3a and c-upper panel). In contrast, both populations expressed high levels of the apoptotic marker annexin V and displayed a similar death index after 19 days pi (n\n = 6/day; Fig. 3b and c-bottom panel). These results indicate that compared to Teff cells, Treg cells proliferated to a lower extent during T. cruzi infection. To further study the capacity of Treg cells to expand during T. cruzi infection we used the PC61 antibody to deplete CD25+ T cells before T. cruzi inoculation. This schedule of PC61 administration minimizes the depletion of Teff cells, which rapidly express CD25 upon infection. As expected, PC61 treatment before infection totally depleted CD25+ T cells from blood and lymphoid organs by the time of T. cruzi inoculation (Fig. 3d). However, it only depleted \u223c60\u201370% of Foxp3+ expressing T cells. Upon infection, the proportion of remaining and/or induced Treg cells rapidly decreased, reaching similar levels to untreated infected mice by day 17 pi (Fig. 3e). In addition, the Treg/Teff cell ratio attained almost similar levels by day 10 pi in PBS and PC61 infected groups (Fig. 3f). Of note, PC61 treatment enhanced the parasitemia only at the end of acute phase (Fig. 3g) but without worsening the disease outcome (Fig. 3h). Together, these findings indicate that CD25+ cell depletion does not change the course of T. cruzi infection. CD25+ cells maintain their capacity to expand and activate during the acute infection, but are mainly represented by Teff cells. Thus, early since T. cruzi infection, although T cells expand, the gradual decrease of the Treg/Teff ratio can be attributed to a selective impairment of Treg cell proliferation compared to Teff cells.",

Accordingly, cells with a central memory profile recirculate through secondary lymphoid tissues, whereas cells with an effector memory profile recirculate predominantly among non-lymphoid tissues. To study the effector- or memory-like profile acquired by T cells during disease, we defined na\u00efve, central memory (CM) and effector memory (EM) cells as CD62LhiCD44low, CD62LhiCD44hi, and CD62LlowCD44hi, respectively as shown in Fig. 4a. In the spleen, a significant increase in the proportion of Teff cells with an effector memory phenotype was observed at 14 days pi, which was paralleled by a diminution of na\u00efve cells (Fig. 4b and c). In contrast, EM Treg cells diminished significantly, while the na\u00efve ones diminished slightly at day 14 pi and afterwards tended to keep within the same level (Fig. 4b and c). Along infection, CM cells showed similar proportions between Treg and Teff cells (Fig. 4d). Consequently, in the spleen, Teff cells showed a more strong capacity to turn into an effector phenotype than Treg cells, during infection.",

Of note, the MFI of Foxp3 in splenic Treg cells significantly increased by day14 pi. Remarkably, at day 21 pi, the MFI of Foxp3 was drastically decreased to levels even lower than the basal ones (Fig. 4m and n). Similar tendencies were observed in dLN and blood (data not shown).

At the same time, the same factors might favor the Teff cell response. Since Th1, Th2 and Th17 responses contribute to an effective anti-T. cruzi response, we assessed the production of IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-17 by splenic Treg and Teff cells and the expression of their associated canonical transcription factors: T-bet, GATA-3 and ROR-\u03b3t. Albeit to a lower proportion than Teff cells, during infection Treg cells also acquired a Th1-like polarized pattern, as indicated by the detection of IFN-\u03b3 production (Fig. 5\na and c) and T-bet induction (Fig. 5e and g). As expected, infected animals showed an important proportion of IFN-\u03b3-expressing Teff cells (Fig. 5b and d) paralleled to a strong up-regulation of T-bet expression (Fig. 5f and h). Th17 profile analysis showed that only a low proportion of CD4+ Teff and Treg cells synthetized IL-17 and expressed ROR-\u03b3t in uninfected animals and both became undetectable after infection (data not shown). Additionally, Treg and Teff cells showed no detectable levels of IL-4 or IL-10 expression (data not shown) which might be explained by the strongly down-regulation of GATA-3 expression along infection (Fig. 5i\u2013l). Likewise, GATA-3 basal expression in Treg cells was \u223c3-fold times higher than the observed in Teff cells, and both gradually diminished till near undetectable levels by day 19 pi (Fig. 5i). These results show that T. cruzi-driven inflammation promotes a Th1 effector phenotype in Teff cells but at the same time induces a skewed Th1-like profile in Treg cells.",

IL-2 is the more evident key player in the promotion of Treg cell expansion and survival, but other cytokines may also influence Treg cell fate and their Th-like profile, like IL-12 cytokine family members (IL-23 and IL-27) and IL-6 among many others (La Cava, 2008). While IL-23 seems to be involved in the development of the Th17 response, IL-12 and IL-27 are involved in the development of the Th1-like phenotype by up-regulating the expression of the transcription factor T-bet in T cells (Yoshimoto et al., 2007). Thus, to evaluate the inflammatory milieu during T. cruzi infection, splenic cells obtained along different time points upon infection were ex vivo stimulated with PMA/ionomycin and assayed for IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-23p19, IL-27p28, IL-10 and TGF- \u03b2 mRNA expression levels by RT-qPCR. As seen in Fig. 6\n, splenic IL-2, IL-12p40 and IL-23p19 transcript levels remained unchanged along the whole experimental procedure. IL-6 mRNA levels peaked by day14 pi and dropped to near basal levels by day 21 pi. Strikingly, IL-27p28 mRNA expression was clearly up-regulated all along the infection. TGF-\u03b2 was progressively reduced upon infection, while IL-10, which was undetectable in uninfected animals, increased by day 14 pi and slightly decreased by day 21 pi. Of note, in this model T. cruzi infection reproducibly induces an important splenomegaly as a consequence of the strong immune activation, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1a. Consequently, when we weight-adjusted transcript levels to mg of splenic tissue, we observed that all mRNA analyzed are increased during the infection (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The most strikingly results were observed for IL-27p28, which mRNA levels increased both at relative and at tissue expression levels, suggesting that IL-27 could contribute to shape the T cell fate during acute infection.",

Thus, we tested a similar strategy to boost Treg cells early during T. cruzi infection. IL-2 treatment of uninfected mice during 10 consecutive days, induced a \u223c2 time increase of blood Treg cells (untreated mice: 4.6 \u00b1 0.9; IL-2 treated mice: 9.4 \u00b1 1.2; p\n < 0.05). However, low-dose IL-2 administration during the first 5 or 10 days of infection failed to increase the percentage or absolute number of Treg cells (not shown) and the Treg/Teff ratio was similar in IL-2-treated and untreated mice (Fig. 7\na). Interestingly, in infected animals treated with IL-2, there was a significant increase not only in the proportion of CD25+ Treg cells, but also in CD25+Teff cells, suggesting that upon T. cruzi challenge low-dose IL-2 treatment loses specificity for Treg cells. Indeed, the administration of low-dose IL-2 mainly activated Teff cells, since at day 21 pi the increment of CD25+ T cells was of \u223c47% and \u223c10% in Teff and Treg cells, respectively (Fig. 7b). This failure of low-dose IL-2 therapy to specifically boost Treg cells was associated with no changes in the course of infection as attested by unchanged parasitemia (Fig. 7c) and mice survival (Fig. 7d).",

Thus, we hypothesized that Dex could synergize with low-doses of IL-2 to boost endogenous Treg cells and improve T. cruzi infection. To that end, we first compared the impact of the administration of IL-2, Dex alone or the combined treatment (IL-2 + Dex) on Treg cells in uninfected C57BL/6 mice. As shown in Fig. 8\na, all treatments increased blood Treg cell frequencies by day 7, being Dex and IL-2 + Dex effects significantly higher and longer lasting. Also, in the spleen, upon Dex and IL-2 + Dex administration, Treg/Teff ratio remained elevated for at least up to 14 days (Fig. 8b, left panel), being the combined treatment the most effective. In addition, IL-2 + Dex administration, increase the absolute number of Treg cells (Fig. 8b, right panel). Thus, considering the synergistic effect of the combined treatment to boost Treg cells in uninfected animals we tested the therapeutic potential of this treatment when administered in a prophylactic schedule, beginning 7 days before infection. Although this treatment did not modify the parasitemia (Fig. 8c), it significantly increased mice survival time (p\n < 0.05; Fig. 8d) demonstrating a better control of inflammation. Of note, Treg cells from IL-2 + Dex treated and infected mice displayed enhanced proliferation 14 days after infection, as indicated by the significant increased percentage of Ki-67+ Treg cells (Fig. 8e) and lower cell death (Fig. 8f) in treated animals compared to the others groups. These results indicate that IL-2 + Dex treatment favors the expansion and survival of Treg cells exposed to the T. cruzi-induced inflammatory environment. To evaluate if these changes were associated with differential Th-polarization patterns of Treg cells and Teff cells during infection, we next assessed the expression levels of T-bet, ROR-\u03b3t, GATA-3, IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, IL-4 and IL-10 in both populations. Interestingly, IL-2 + Dex treatment was associated with an increase in IFN-\u03b3 production and T-bet expression by Treg and Teff cells from IL-2 + Dex treated and infected mice (Fig. 9a and b, respectively). Notably, the combined treatment also induced the expression of GATA-3 (Fig. 9c) and the appearance of a small proportion of Treg cells producing IL-4 and IL-10 (\u223c2.5% and \u223c4%, respectively). Similar results were observed in Teff cells (data not shown). It is remarkable that by day 14pi, \u223c40% of the Treg cells of IL-2 + Dex pre-treated mice were GATA-3+, compared to only \u223c6% of the Teff cells.",

Thus, studies reporting the role of Treg cells in the control of infection or immunopathology are controversial, whereby the dynamic that is established between Treg and Teff cells during infection still remains unclear (Kotner and Tarleton, 2007, Sales et al., 2008). We previously demonstrated that T. cruzi infection in C57BL/6 mice induces an exacerbated and dysregulated Th1 pro-inflammatory response associated with lethal immunopathology, mainly because of a collapsed immune-endocrine regulatory network (Perez et al., 2007, Roggero et al., 2002, Roggero et al., 2006). Expanding our previous findings, we show here that during infection Treg cells seem dysfunctional and overwhelmed by the Teff cell response. In addition, decreasing physiological corticosterone levels by Adx does not induce changes in Treg cell numbers. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time that endogenous glucocorticoids released in response to T. cruzi-driven immune activation are crucial to sustain the Treg/Teff ratio, reinforcing the view that besides intrinsic immunological mechanisms, inflammation is also under an endocrine control.",

Is known that glucocorticoids mediate their biological effects through the binding to their cognate intracellular receptor, which translocates to the nucleus and targets specific sequences called glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in the promoter regions of glucocorticoid-inducible genes (Vandevyver et al., 2013). Thus, Treg and Teff cells might differ in the level of glucocorticoid receptor expression and in the number of GREs, and in addition, the promoter region of Foxp3 gene expression might be under the positive control of GREs (transactivation), favoring the Treg cell expansion and suppressor function. In addition, glucocorticoids can also modulate gene expression via trans repression, a mechanism largely based on protein:protein interactions (Ratman et al., 2013), which could differ between Treg and Teff cells. However, these possibilities have not yet been investigated.",

These conflicted data could be caused by dissimilarities in the doses and timing of glucocorticoid administration, variances in the characterization of Treg cells (CD25+Foxp3+, CD4+CD25high, CD25+Foxp3+, etc) and also intrinsic differences in the immunological background of studied diseases (Chen et al., 2006, W\u00fcst et al., 2008, Karagiannidis et al., 2004, Azab et al., 2008, Sbiera et al., 2011, Pandolfi et al., 2013). Of note, these studies were carried out mainly in autoimmune backgrounds and might profoundly differ from an infectious condition. In our hands, the endogenous levels of corticosterone appear to preferentially affect Teff than Treg cells. It is plausible that, besides glucocorticoids, other adrenal hormones could influence Treg/Teff cell homeostasis and cytokine profile during T. cruzi infection. In accordance, it has been proposed that the timing of glucocorticoid response and the levels of anti-glucocorticoid hormones like DHEA could affect the cellular response and the course of experimental tuberculosis (Hernandez-Pando et al., 1998).",

Interleukin-2 is the more prominent cytokine involved in the expansion and survival of peripheral Treg cells (Fontenot et al., 2005a, Fontenot et al., 2005b). Nevertheless, the incapacity of splenic Treg cells to expand, proliferate and activate during this parasitic infection does not appear to be dependent on the bioavailability of IL-2, since splenic IL-2 mRNA levels are preserved along infection. Moreover, IL-2 supplementation at low doses during the course of disease fails to increase Treg cell numbers.

In our experimental model of T. cruzi infection, we observed a significant increase in the proportion of Teff cells with EM phenotype at the expense of a diminution in the proportion of Treg cells with this phenotype, clearly highlighting that in this extremely inflammatory milieu, Treg cells are less efficient than Teff cells to get activated. This striking observation may result from either a Treg cell-specific sensitivity to inflammatory cues or to a relative lower frequency of T. cruzi specific-Treg cells compared to Teff cells. In addition, this profile might affect the proper homing of EM Tregs to peripheral organs, necessary to cope with inflammation. Of note, it has been previously shown that an inflammatory environment characterized by increased systemic levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 is rapidly installed upon T. cruzi infection in C57BL/6 mice (Perez et al., 2007, Roggero et al., 2002), and accompanied by a delayed production of anti-inflammatory mediators. Expanding these observations we now document an early systemic increase of IFN-\u03b3 together with a detectable, yet delayed, production of IL-10, and increased splenic transcripts for pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Since IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 can exert inhibitory actions on Treg cells, affecting their differentiation, proliferation and function (La Cava, 2008), as well as rendering Teff cells refractory to Treg cell suppression, present changes in cytokine dynamics may contribute to the failure of the regulatory response (Caretto et al., 2010, O\u2019Sullivan et al., 2006, Valencia et al., 2006, Wan et al., 2007).",

It is not surprising, therefore, that under the highly Th1-polarized microenvironment arising during T. cruzi infection, an emergence of T-bet and IFN-\u03b3 expressing Treg cells occurs, paralleling the acquisition of a Th1 phenotype by Teff cells (Sakaguchi et al., 2013, Koch et al., 2009). The secretion of IFN-\u03b3 during T. cruzi infection likely contributes to host tissue injury, activating tissue macrophages to secrete TNF-\u03b1 and to damage heart and other tissues (Silverio et al., 2012). Moreover, the acquisition of this effector phenotype might favor their traffic to Th1-inflammed tissues and disturb their local suppressor function (Smigiel et al., 2014).",

Moreover, GATA-3 plays a key role in Treg cell physiology during inflammatory processes, influencing Treg accumulation in inflamed tissues and sustaining Foxp3 expression (Wohlfert et al., 2011). Here, we observed that during T. cruzi infection, although there is a substantial proportion of Teff cells that acquire T-bet expression, very few Teff cells become GATA-3+, reinforcing the view that this lethal infection is associated with a highly skewed Teff Th1-like polarization. Concerning Treg cells, the proportion of these cells expressing GATA-3 gradually diminished from \u223c12% in uninfected mice to almost undetectable levels by day 19 pi. Moreover, this loss of GATA-3 expression in Treg cells was accompanied by a gain in T-bet expression and in the production of IFN-\u03b3. Of note, these findings are associated to the scarce presence of Treg cells in T. cruzi-target tissues and the diminution of Foxp3 MFI. These data reminds findings from Wohlfert et al.

            "text": "Nowadays, acute Chagas disease is treated by chemotherapy targeted to the parasite. However, these therapies can be toxic and fail due to diverse causes. Although in children chemotherapies are quite effective (\u223c57 and 71% of cure in chronic or acute phase, respectively), a substantial amount of treatment failures is seen in adults (Matta Guedes et al., 2012). Regarding Benznidazol, we and others have described that this drug not only kills the parasite but also exert immunomodulatory effects (Piaggio et al., 2001, Ronco et al., 2011). Consequently, modulating the inflammatory response associated to T. cruzi infection stands as a promising approach for tackling this disease. Along these lines, boosting endogenous Treg cells sounds instrumental to dampen inflammation. One strategy to activate Treg cells is the administration of low doses of IL-2 which has been shown by us and others to effectively activate Treg cells reinforcing their suppressive function and contributing to the control chronic inflammation and autoimmunity in mice (Tang et al., 2008, Webster et al., 2009, Wilson et al., 2008, Dinh et al., 2012) and humans (Koreth et al., 2011, Saadoun et al., 2011). Particularly, we showed that low-dose IL-2 administration to pre-diabetic NOD mice which prevents disease development, increases Treg proportions specifically in the pancreas and these IL-2 expanded Treg cells express higher levels of Bcl-2, CD25, and Foxp3, suggestive of increased resistance to apoptosis and higher activation (Tang et al., 2008, Grinberg-Bleyer et al., 2010). Here, we administered for the first time low doses of IL-2 during T. cruzi infection. However, IL-2 doses similar to the ones successfully used to treat type 1 diabetes (Grinberg-Bleyer et al., 2010) did not show any noticeable effect on parasitemia and immunopathology. This lack of efficacy of IL-2 treatment can be explained by the fact that upon T. cruzi infection, Teff cells rapidly up-regulate CD25 and consequently become highly sensitive to low doses of IL-2, being the IL-2-specific effect on Treg cells lost.",

Thus, we first studied the effect of these drugs on Treg cells in untreated mice, and observed synergistic effects of the combined treatment. Consequently, we tested the modulatory potential of combined IL-2 + Dex pre-treatment on T. cruzi infection. We showed that Dex + IL-2 combined therapy improved Treg cell proliferation and survival and favors Treg/Teff ratio; in addition to inducing Treg GATA-3 expression and IL-4 and IL-10 production during infection, suggesting a better immune balance. Moreover, an increase in mouse survival time, in our highly lethal model of T. cruzi infection was observed upon combined treatment with Dex + IL-2. These findings were associated with a splenic microenvironment enriched in IL-10 and IL-27p28 transcript levels. Along these lines, Hall and collaborators showed that during T. gondii infection, IL-27 improved T-bet expression and enhanced IL-10 secretion by Treg cells, enhancing their Th1-suppressor capacity (Hall et al., 2012a). Moreover, IL-27 can promote IL-10 production by Teff cells (Hall et al., 2012b). Thus, besides the known beneficial anti-inflammatory effects that IL-10 exerts on Teff cells, IL-27 increased production might also be involved in the dampening of inflammation. In addition, besides we were unable to quantified transcripts of IL-4 in splenocytes, the fact that IL-4 expression was also detected in Treg and Teff cells after IL-2 + Dex treatment also gives a notion that combined treatment induces a more balanced Th1/Th2 response.",

We show that endogenous glucocorticoids influence the Treg and Teff cell dynamics during T. cruzi infection, affecting mainly the Teff response. Moreover, rapidly upon infection, Treg cells acquire a typical Th-1 like pathogenic phenotype and are overwhelmed by rapidly proliferating Teff cells. Interestingly, the demonstration that administration of IL-2 + Dex modulates Treg/Teff homeostasis and influence disease outcome opens new perspectives for preventing the immunopathology associated to T. cruzi infection. Indeed, our results pave the way to the design of optimized therapies aimed to specifically boost Treg cells during T. cruzi infection, which combined with antiparasitic drugs may help to control both the parasite and the excessive pathologic inflammatory process induced by it.",
