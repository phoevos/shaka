            "text": "Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) was first marketed in 1899, after the German chemist Felix Hoffman, a scientist at Bayer Industries, modified the commonly used sodium salt of salicylic acid by acetylation, in an effort to diminish the digestive side effects that troubled his father who suffered from Rheumatoid Arthritis. The medication soon enjoyed explosive growth, establishing Bayer Pharmaceuticals as the first modern pharmaceutical company. However, from the beginning the use of aspirin has been tempered by the occurrence of various side effects, the incidences of which were principally related to the dose of drug and duration of therapy.",

            "text": "Despite any side effects, its use as a household remedy was long established prior to the birth of modern pharmaceutical Regulatory Agencies. Principally because of this, and the fact that it was widely regarded as safe and effective, aspirin was \u2018grandfathered\u2019 into both prescription and over-the-counter use, without the performance of the myriad of pre-and post-marketing, randomised, clinical trials that today would be required for any new drug. While initially helpful, this has left the medical use of aspirin at some informational disadvantages. While there is an abundance of data from randomised, double-blind, clinical trials, of the long-term use of relatively low doses of aspirin in the prophylaxis of thrombotic vascular events, (affecting the heart, brain and other organs), and in the prevention of various cancers, there is a comparative paucity of such information attending the short-term use of often higher doses of aspirin, in what has been its main use, i.e. taking it for short times, usually without prescription, in the relief of acute pain, fever, and the symptoms of the common cold or influenza. This review attempts to gather available evidence about these applications in the context of contemporary use of this old-fashioned but still valuable drug.",

In contrast, all available will be pooled in analysing data on gastrointestinal tolerability and risks of the drug in various trials.

The majority (>80%) of the patients were females, aged 18\u201365 years, and had had migraine for at least 12 months prior to the study period, with 1\u20136 moderate-to-severe attacks/month. The diagnosis of migraine in all cases was in agreement with guidelines issued by the International Headache Society (IHS). Five of the studies used a placebo comparator, four used only an active comparator, and five used both. In most cases the active comparator was sumatriptan 50 mg or 100 mg. The efficacies of all active comparators were superior to placebo. In the case of aspirin, both doses were equally effective, with NNTs of 8.1, 4.9 and 6.6, for 2-h pain-free, 2 h headache relief, and 24-h headache relief, for ASA vs. placebo. There was no additional benefit derived from the addition of 10 mg of metoclopramide (MTC) in relieving headache, but the combination did reduce associated nausea and vomiting compared to ASA alone. Sumatriptan 50 mg did not differ from ASA alone for 2-h pain-free or 2-h headache relief, but sumatriptan 100 mg was better than the combination of ASA + MTC for 2-h pain-free, but not for headache relief: no 24 h-relief data were given. The authors concluded that ASA 1000 mg is effective in treating acute migraine headaches, similar to sumatriptan 50 mg or 100 mg, and that addition of metoclopramide reduces nausea and vomiting but does not increase the relief of pain.",

There are some differences in efficacy that relate to the severity of the initial headache. In a publication comparing the efficacy of 1000 mg of effervescent ASA with 50 mg of sumatriptan in migraine, a subgroup analysis of 370 patients with severe pain at baseline vs. 564 patients with moderate pain at baseline, showed higher treatment responses to both drugs in those with moderate pain at baseline. Both drugs were significantly better than placebo in both subgroups, but there was no statistically significant difference between the drugs in either group [17]. Aspirin is effective in headache.",

The first study [22] examined the effect of a single dose of 800 mg of aspirin in 139 patients with a sore throat due to a respiratory infection, compared to the outcome in 139 placebo-treated patients. The primary outcome measure was 2-h Sum of total Pain Intensity Differences (SPID), and ASA was much superior to placebo (p\n < 0.0001). For all secondary end-points, ASA also achieved statistically superiority compared to placebo. In the second similar study [23], 68 patient received ASA 800 mg alone, 70 received ASA 800 mg + 64 mg of caffeine, and 69 received placebo. Under double-blind conditions, during a 2-h evaluation period, patients used different rating scales to assess pain intensity, change in pain, pain relief, and two qualities of throat pain, i.e. how swollen the throat felt, and difficulty in swallowing. Both active treatments were significantly more effective than placebo, for all efficacy measurements, from 30 min through 2 h, and ASA-plus-caffeine was superior to ASA alone. Specifically, in the 2 h SPID dimension, ASA was highly significantly superior to placebo (p\n < 0.01) [23]. Again aspirin was clearly effective. Many patients with sore throat dissolve 2 ASA tablets in warm water, gargle with this solution for 5\u201310 min, and then swallow the material. Despite its popularity, and that of combining dissolved ASA with topical local anaesthetics, the efficacy of this method of using ASA has not been evaluated.",

The response rate ratio (RRR), for ASA achieving at least moderate pain relief compared to placebo, was 1.6 (95% CI: 1.12, 2.29), though data were not easily combined. In an even earlier study published in 1982 [26], an analysis was made of data relating to pain of female genital origin from over 4000 post-surgical, post-episiotomy patients, and those with uterine cramping from any cause, who had received 325 mg, 650 mg, 1300 mg of ASA or placebo for pain. Despite the analysis of a mixed bag of patients, statistically significant benefits compared to placebo were apparent for single doses of ASA from 325 mg to 1300 mg, and for a daily dose of 2600 mg [26]. Additional studies of more modern design and execution would be helpful in determining the magnitude of the benefit of ASA, and the correct dose for optimal OTC use.

A \u2018cold\u2019 typically presents with runny nose, cough, sore throat and chills. Occasionally there may be other accompanying symptoms such as fever, conjunctivitis, headache, muscle aches, fatigue and other vague symptoms. The condition has been reviewed in depth by Eccles [28]. While a cold is \u2018influenza-like\u2019, and may be accompanied by \u2018chills\u2019 or a real sensation of \u2018chilliness\u2019, fever is mild, uncommon and transient. In true influenza the symptoms are generally more severe, with prominent cough, sustained fevers, and onset of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, the conditions are often confused at the onset. There is no cure for the common cold but, unlike influenza, the symptoms are mild and usually treated with over-the-counter remedies. Among these is aspirin, a drug believed to reduce symptoms although it cannot shorten or prevent the disease. Getting \u2018a cold\u2019 is one of the most frequent reasons for patients to consult a physician. Two studies done in the setting of \u2018cold\u2019 have already been quoted in the section on \u2018sore throat\u2019, and ASA was clearly effective [22], [23]. There are three additional controlled trials of ASA use in treating colds and fever, in one of which ASA treatment was compared to placebo, and in two of which it was compared to another active treatment. These studies are summarised in Table 3\n.",

Unanswered is whether use of any of the newer marketed forms of aspirin (effervescent tablets, dry granules, chewable tablets, caplets, or carbasalate calcium tablets) will prove, in head-to-head comparison trials, to have any significant clinical advantage over each other, or over currently available plain tablets. Similarly, there is a scarcity of valuable information on the value of short-term use of aspirin in combination with other drugs, e.g. metoclopramide, pseudoephedrine, lidocaine, dextromethorphan, Vitamin C and caffeine, all of which combinations are sold OTC. Evaluation of these efficacies is beyond the scope of this review. Nevertheless, the efficacy of ASA can be regarded as established in all of the ailments reviewed.",

As later emerged from largely observational studies, use of aspirin or other NSAIDs was also occasionally associated with serious gastrointestinal complications such as perforation, haemorrhage, obstruction and even death, although the majority of the deaths have occurred in elderly patients with serious co-morbid conditions [34].

Detailed accounting for many of these factors is commonly lacking in epidemiological studies. The incidence of GI symptoms is usually ignored. Because of the large number of additional factors which attend the outcome of aspirin use in individuals or in specific groups, the exact risk of a dose of aspirin causing an Adverse Effect (AE) in any particular situation is quite variable. The GI recently reviewed safety of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor drugs in general, pertains mainly to serious events, long-term use, in chronic conditions, and is limited to outcomes attributed to ulcers [36]. These data have no direct relevance to this paper, but furnish a background as to why some vague concerns among physicians and members of the public, about the GI safety and tolerability of ASA, may spill over into limiting short-term use of an effective compound in very different settings, i.e. to relieve the acute symptoms of pain, fever or a \u2018cold\u2019, in otherwise healthy adults.",

How closely conclusions presented here reflect actual consequences of OTC use of ASA in the general population, awaits the results of larger surveys, but these findings suggest that safety concerns should not limit brief, symptomatic, use of this very effective drug.",
