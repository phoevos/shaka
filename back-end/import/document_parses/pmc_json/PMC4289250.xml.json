The mainstays of induction therapy are drugs that are more than 50 years old (amphotericin B and flucytosine), although these are often poorly available where the disease burden is highest. Although amphotericin therapy is undoubtedly superior to fluconazole monotherapy, amphotericin combination therapy has only recently been shown to reduce mortality when compared with amphotericin monotherapy. Whereas effective antifungal therapy is the key, adjunctive treatments, which have been seen to have dramatic effects on mortality in other neurologic infections, are untested in cryptococcal meningitis. Given the high death rates in patients receiving current optimal treatment, and the paucity of new agents on the horizon, adjuvant treatments offer the greatest potential to reduce mortality in CM.",

The Infectious Diseases Society of America convenes an international panel to draw up treatment guidelines, most recently published in 2010, and the WHO currently has guidelines in development that will be specifically aimed at management in resource-poor countries. These conform closely to the IDSA guidelines. Treatment generally consists of a period of induction therapy by using high-dose or combination antifungal therapy (usually for 2 weeks), followed by a period of consolidation therapy of 8 weeks with fluconazole. After this time, provided that the patient has responded to treatment, secondary prophylaxis using lower-dose fluconazole is given to prevent disease relapse. It is generally considered safe to stop secondary prophylaxis if ARV therapy has resulted in suppression of the plasma viral load and immune reconstitution with recovery of the CD4 cell count to >100 cells/\u03bcl has lasted for at least 6 months).",

Current IDSA guidelines suggest that corticosteroids may be beneficial in cryptococcal meningitis in patients who have cryptococcomas with mass effect, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or IRIS [4]. However, corticosteroids have never been tested in a randomised controlled trial. Of note, 150 of 381 patients in the ACTG trial of combination antifungal therapy in cryptococcal meningitis received steroids during the study. The Graybill (2000) post hoc analysis of these patients has some serious limitations (1997) [5, 6]. Steroids were prescribed at the discretion of the attending physician, and the reasons for prescription are unclear. The Graybill analysis was limited to just 41 of the 150 steroid recipients, and did not report their impact on mortality. Clinical success (defined as stabilisation or improvement at 2 weeks) was lower in the 41 steroid recipients analysed (66% versus 86%). Apparently worse mycologic outcomes in these 41 patients are impossible to interpret, because no adjustments were made for the antifungal therapy received, fungal load, or clinical severity at baseline, all of which are known to be important outcome predictors [7, 8]. The exclusion from the analysis of the vast majority of patients who received steroids means that it is impossible to draw robust conclusions about their effect and underlines the need for a trial.",

The basilar meningitis leads to impairment of resorption of CSF, and this, along with physical blockage of CSF drainage by yeast cells and conglomerations of capsule, is believed to contribute to the increased intracranial pressure seen in the disease [11]. The immune response in the mouse model mimics that seen in AIDS patients [12]. The effect of antiinflammatory agents has been tested in this model. Reduction of inflammation prolongs survival in mice infected with a lethal dose of C. neoformans[13]. Dexamethasone increases median survival from 19 to 26 days (P <0.05), a benefit preserved when dexamethasone is combined with amphotericin B [14]. Dexamethasone does not interfere with the pharmacologic properties of amphotericin or fluconazole [14, 15]. Moderation of the inflammatory response is postulated to be through microglial cells, a key in the immune response to CM [16].",

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent inducer of vascular permeability and angiogenesis, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of brain oedema [18, 19]. Elevated levels are seen in both the CSF and blood of HIV patients with cryptococcal meningitis, and cryptococcal capsule has been shown to induce VEGF production by monocytes, neutrophils, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a dose-dependent manner [18, 20]. In vitro, this induction is significantly downregulated by dexamethasone [18]. Downregulation occurs at a range of concentrations consistent with those achieved in human dosing. A rat model of brain oedema suggests that the effect of steroids on oedema is mediated through the inhibition of VEGF [21]. Corticosteroids reduce vascular permeability and limit oedema, and inhibition of VEGF may explain the beneficial effect of steroid therapy in TBM [10, 22].",

In this study, we will measure the rate of clearance of yeast from CSF (see Appendix 1). Patients with CM are profoundly immunosuppressed: the median CD4 count in Vietnamese patients is 16 cells/\u03bcl (which compares with a median CD4 count of 42 in Vietnamese HIV patients with tuberculous meningitis) [38]. Given this, whether dexamethasone will significantly increase the risk of other opportunistic infections (OIs) is not clear. The incidence of other OIs is a secondary end point of the study.

Although all patients will be encouraged to return to the study hospital in the event of illness during the 6-month follow-up period, it is possible that, because of their location, some patients will undergo treatment elsewhere where diagnostic facilities may be less developed. This episode may only be identified at the 6-month follow-up period. For this reason, a pragmatic definition of relapse will be used. This is defined as either intensification of antifungal therapy above that according to the study antifungal schedule, or readmission for treatment of cryptococcal disease.

The main measures of effectiveness will be (a) life years gained (b) quality-adjusted life years gained (QALYs), estimated by using the EQ-5D instrument in official English, Vietnamese, and Thai languages in its three-level version, and (c) disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, which measures both years of life lost because of premature mortality and years lived with disability. Life years gained will be based on the primary outcome measure of survival at 10 weeks, extrapolated by using best estimates of longer-term survival in each country for HIV-infected adults. QALY and DALY estimates will adjust the life-year estimates by taking into account secondary end points, including blindness, deafness, and other neurologic disabilities that are important sequelae of cryptococcal disease. QALY adjustment will be done by using EQ-5D-3 L responses, and DALY adjustment by using clinical judgment to align recorded morbidity with DALY states.

            "text": "The main indication to stop the study drug is if the patient develops a condition for which there is good evidence that steroids are beneficial and should be prescribed. Examples of this are as follows:Tuberculous meningitis: Dexamethasone has been demonstrated in a large randomised controlled trial to reduce the risk of death [10]. If a patient develops TB meningitis, the study drug should be stopped, and the patient should receive the appropriate dosage of steroids according to the severity of the disease. This does not necessitate unblinding of treatment allocation.Intracranial space-occupying lesion with mass effect: For example, a primary brain tumour such as CNS lymphoma. Space-occupying lesion with mass effect is generally considered to be an indication for steroid therapy. A typical dose would be dexamethasone, 4 mg, 4 times daily. The study drug should be stopped in all patients, and the patient should receive corticosteroid treatment as per local guidelines. This does not necessitate unblinding of treatment allocation.Note: a suspected cryptococcoma is not an indication to alter the study drug; we do not know whether dexamethasone is indicated in this case, and the study is testing this indication.Severe pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP): All patients in the study must receive PCP prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole; this reduces the risk of developing PCP. However, PCP may still occur. Microbiologic confirmation of PCP is not always possible, and the diagnosis is often made on clinical grounds. The chest radiograph typically shows bilateral interstitial, often perihilar, shadowing. The differential diagnosis of this appearance includes bacterial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to cryptococcosis. The gold standard for diagnosis of PCP is to demonstrate the presence of Pneumocystis jirovecii in bronchoalveolar lavage washings or in induced sputum samples. Severe PCP is confirmed when there is a typical clinical syndrome is present AND the arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (pO2) is less than 70 mm Hg (FiO2 \u2265 20%). Prednisolone (40 mg twice daily for 5 days, 40 mg once daily for 5 days, followed by 20 mg/day for 11 days), in combination with high dose co-trimoxazole, has been shown to reduce the risk of death from severe PCP [41]. Where arterial blood gas measurement is not available, diagnosis of severe PCP should be made in accordance with local guidelines. In any patient in whom the diagnosis of severe PCP is made, the study drug must be stopped immediately, and the patient treated with prednisolone in conventional doses, and high dose co-trimoxazole as per local guidelines. This does not necessitate unblinding of treatment allocation.",

Thus, if a patient wants to withdraw from the study, and has received 5 or more days of study drug, then the withdrawal phase of steroid dosing will be started immediately; the patient will be switched to the next dexamethasone dose in the steroid-dosing sequence. For example, if on day 16, a patient wants to leave the study, then he or she will be immediately switched to the next phase of steroid/placebo dose (3 mg/day), and the treatment tailed off according to the treatment schedule (Table 4).

Additionally, in a study of dexamethasone in bacterial meningitis in Vietnam, the HR was 0.43 in patients with microbiologically confirmed disease, and 0.59 in a study based in Europe, again in favour of dexamethasone [34, 35]. These analyses were all based on the intention-to-treat principle (including noncompliant patients), and it seems sensible to expect a similar rate of noncompliance in our study. Therefore, we believe a target hazard ratio of 0.7 in favour of dexamethasone to be reasonable for our trial.",

Stopping for harm of dexamethasone should be considered if an unfavourable trend emerges, sufficiently large to rule out a clinically relevant benefit of dexamethasone. Conclusive evidence that dexamethasone is harmful is not sought, as continued exposure of patients to a nonbeneficial novel treatment that could be harmful appears to be unethical. To support the DMEC decision, the DMEC will receive conditional power curves in addition to the summaries described earlier. Conditional power assesses the probability that a benefit of dexamethasone will eventually be detected, conditional on the data accrued so far.
