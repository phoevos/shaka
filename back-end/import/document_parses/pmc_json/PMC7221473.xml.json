Such a presidential endorsement stimulated an rapid increase in demand for hydroxychloroquine, which obscured the negative aspects of this drug. Deaths due to chloroquine overdoses have been reported in Nigeria among people self-treating for apparent covid-19.9 Retinopathy and gastrointestinal and cardiac side effects are well documented with the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of malarial and rheumatic diseases.10 Hydroxychloroquine is preferred in clinical applications owing to its lower toxicity, particularly retinal toxicity,10 and three times the potency against SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with chloroquine in a recent in vitro study.5 No convincing evidence from well designed clinical trials exists to support the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with good efficacy and safety for the treatment of covid-19. Rapidly conducting such trials with high quality is challenging in the face of a dangerous coronavirus outbreak, in which healthcare workers have an overwhelming amount of work and the highest risk of developing covid-19.11\n",

The principal investigators invited hospitals with the capability to provide the current standard of care for covid-19 to participate in the study. Minimum requirements for the standard of care included the provision of intravenous fluids, supplemental oxygen, regular laboratory testing, SARS-CoV-2 testing, haemodynamic monitoring, and intensive care, as well as the ability to deliver concomitant medications. The trial was conducted urgently during the outbreak of covid-19 in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local regulatory requirements. Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding donated the investigated drug, hydroxychloroquine but was not involved in the study design, accrual, analyses of data, or preparation of the manuscript. A contract research organisation, R&G PharmaStudies, was hired to assist in the study design, data collection and cleaning, and statistical analyses. Data were recorded by clinical research coordinators, followed by queries from clinical research associates. The study statistician then entered confirmed data into the OpenClinica database for statistical analyses performed by and reviewed by the senior statistician in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

After a two round extensive review of the efficacy and safety data generated from the interim analysis, the IDMC endorsed an early termination of the trial. Members of the committee all agreed that the data from the trial are important for clinicians, the public, and the government to avoid inappropriate use of hydroxychloroquine in the clinical management of covid-19, particularly in areas with overwhelming patient numbers. The report of the trial could be an important resource to facilitate better design of future trials.

Patients were enrolled by the site investigators in 16 government designated covid-19 treatment centres in three provinces in China (Hubei, Henan, and Anhui). No placebo was used, and drugs were not masked. We applied stratified random sampling to stratify all eligible patients according to disease severity (mild/moderate or severe), followed by random assignment (in a 1:1 ratio) in each stratum to ensure a balanced distribution of disease severity between treatment (hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care) and control (standard of care only) groups. LL designed the randomisation rules together with the principal investigators, and an independent statistician who was not involved in data analysis implemented them. Equal numbers of cards with each group assignment number randomly generated by computer were placed in sequentially numbered envelopes that were opened as the patients were enrolled. All patients were managed with standard of care aligned with the indications from the updated national clinical practice guidelines for covid-19 in China. Patients in the treatment group were given hydroxychloroquine within 24 hours after randomisation, with a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days (total treatment duration was two weeks for patients with mild to moderate disease and three weeks for those with severe disease). The dose of hydroxychloroquine was adjusted when adverse events were related to hydroxychloroquine, as judged by investigators. Details of dose adjustment are provided in the study protocol available in the online supplement. Patients, investigators, and statisticians were not masked to treatment assignment. Laboratory technicians who did virological, chemical, and other routine measurements were unaware of treatment information.",

With the assumption that time to conversion follows an exponential distribution, if the median time to conversion with hydroxychloroquine can be reduced from 10 days to seven days, a total of 248 events would provide a power of 80% to detect a hazard ratio of 0.7 (standard of care v hydroxychloroquine) with a log rank test.

Covid-19 has overwhelmed hospital systems during the pandemic, and many of these patients may be treated in the community and may finally be admitted to hospital because of a need for oxygen or owing to rapid deterioration of the disease. Data from our trial do not provide evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in this population, particularly considering the increased adverse events (discussed below). Our trial could not assess the antiviral efficacy of hydroxychloroquine at an earlier stage, such as within 48 hours of onset of the illness, the golden window for antiviral treatment in influenza.15 However, conducting such a trial is challenging in patients admitted to hospital and will be easier in outpatient or community settings. The fact that antiviral treatment was not restricted in our trial should also be considered when interpreting our results. Seeing the antiviral effects of hydroxychloroquine when compared with a \u201cpure\u201d control arm would be more conclusive. In the early dangerous outbreak of covid-19 in China, however, setting a restriction on drugs that could be potentially useful was not ethical. Nevertheless, the use of antiviral drugs before and after randomisation was balanced between the hydroxychloroquine and standard of care groups and thus might have little effect on our primary endpoint. Moreover, use of a higher dose of hydroxychloroquine than was used in our trial is not likely to have additional antiviral effects, because the dosage of hydroxychloroquine that we chose achieves the 50% effective concentration (EC50) of hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2,5 although we did not monitor the concentration of hydroxychloroquine in our study. Another important message from our trial is that the Kaplan-Meier curve crossed over with time, suggesting a potential for a non-constant hazard ratio of negative conversion conferred by exposure to hydroxychloroquine. Therefore, the hazard ratios presented in our trial should be interpreted as weighted results over time rather than as a definitive constant. We will investigate this in the future. Further trials might also need to combat this problem when using the Cox regression method. Taken together, future studies could take advantage of our results to design trials in a more selective population, at the earliest stage possible (<48 hours from illness onset), and using more sensitive endpoints, such as viral load shedding.",

Serious adverse events occurred in two patients, and both were reported in hydroxychloroquine recipients. The overall frequency of adverse events was significantly higher in hydroxychloroquine recipients than in non-recipients. Gastrointestinal events, particularly diarrhoea, were most commonly reported, as they were in another study using a high dose of hydroxychloroquine.16 Transient blurred vision was reported in one patient whose symptoms recovered two days after discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine. Early development of retinal damage with a daily dose of 800 to 1200 mg was detected using sensitive retinal screening tests.17 Therefore, the retinal damage could be underestimated in our trial. Events of cardiac arrhythmia, such as prolonged QT interval,18 were not observed in our trial, possibly because of the relatively mild to moderate disease of patients investigated or the short term period of follow-up. However, with increasing interest in the combined use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin worldwide, physicians should be cautious about the increased risk of prolongation of the QT interval and fatal ventricular arrhythmia with azithromycin and other antimicrobial agents.19\n20 Drug-drug interaction should be taken into consideration when assessing safety and efficacy endpoints in future trials of hydroxychloroquine.10 The effects of hydroxychloroquine in causing increased concentrations of digitoxin and metoprolol would be particularly relevant in patients with severe covid-19 and would therefore require close monitoring.21\n",

In such a situation, our study has several limitations. Firstly, the open label, as opposed to double blind, design introduces the possibility of biased investigator determined assessments and unbalanced dosage adjustment. Urgent production of placebos mimicking hydroxychloroquine and the management of a multicentre, placebo controlled trial remain challenging during the pandemic. Secondly, the use of sequential envelopes is inferior to the interactive web response management system for randomisation. Thirdly, the setting of our trial among patients admitted to hospital precluded us from enrolling patients at the early stage of disease. In addition, we cannot provide evidence on the effect of hydroxychloroquine on disease progression or regression because 148/150 (99%) patients in our trial had mild to moderate disease.",

The recruitment of eligible patients was unexpectedly difficult, with many clinical trials launched in the same period in response to the urgent call by the national health authorities for the exploration of effective treatment against covid-19. The rapid decline in eligible new cases owing to the successful containment of covid-19 in the middle of March 2020 in China precluded further recruitment to reach our targeted sample size. The premature termination of our trial also led to increased censoring of data on our primary outcome. We therefore reanalysed the probability of negative conversion in the two groups by using follow-up data to 27 April 2020 (supplementary table B), and the results were consistent with our reported results.",

Hiring a contract research organisation, as we did in our trial, can greatly support the conduct and oversight of trials. Sixthly, population quarantine of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, nationwide travel restrictions, and isolation of cases and contacts were also barriers to collecting and transferring data and paper files. Several prespecified secondary endpoints, including the changes on computed tomography of the chest, were therefore not finished by the cut-off date for analysis. Finally, the specimens collected in our trial for virus RNA determination were mostly from the upper respiratory tract rather than bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which could introduce false negative results.22 However, the prespecified definition for negative conversion of virus was two consecutive negative results at least 24 hours apart, which can reduce false negativity.",
