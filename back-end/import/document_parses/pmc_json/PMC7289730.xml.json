Though COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease, its' insidious and nonspecific clinical course can result in a delayed diagnosis and a prolonged period of self-administered symptomatic treatment. As fever is one of the most common symptoms of COVID-19, antipyretic medications, including ibuprofen, play an important role in controlling patients' symptoms.",

Though no reference was provided, the statement may stem from a report published by the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products, concerning 400 cases of severe infections that were linked temporally to Ibuprofen administration [2]. Adding to these concerns, recent in-vitro work has supported the hypothesis that pathogenic coronaviruses have a high affinity to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and that ACE2 production as well as the ACE 2 receptor expression, can be increased by ibuprofen [3,4].",

At that time the policy of the Israeli ministry of health was to test every patient with symptoms that could be compatible with COVID-19 (cough, dyspnea, fever). Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in the hospital's molecular laboratory that is approved by the Israeli ministry of health. Patients were contacted by phone (mean 13 days after the diagnosis, range 2-30 days), and a short structured questionnaire was administered. Information collected included age, gender, chronic diseases and medications, date of diagnosis, symptoms and factors relating to the clinical course of disease (admission to the hospital and the intensive care unit, need for oxygen or ventilation). For our purpose, severe disease was defined as needing any respiratory support (supplemental oxygen administration or ventilation), ICU admission or death. Patients were asked about the use of any medication containing ibuprofen (a complete list of local commercial names was supplied), paracetamol or dipyrone starting a week prior to diagnosis of COVID-19. In case of mortality, information was obtained from medical charts and referral letters. Chi-square test of independence, Wilcoxon rank sum-test and Fischer's exact test were applied as needed (significance threshold, P < .05). Statistical analyses were performed using R software, version 3.5.3. The study was approved by the Shamir Medical Center Institutional Review Board.",

Among patients with fever, no excess mortality or need for respiratory support were observed in patients who chose to use ibuprofen exclusively. In fact, the need for respiratory support was higher in the paracetamol group with borderline significance. One possible explanation for this could be that elderly patients with more severe chronic illnesses are more likely to be treated with paracetamol due to concern about ibuprofen causing renal injury.",

Second, information from deceased patients could only be collected from medical chart review. However, medications administered prior to hospitalization are noted in the charts. Thirdly, our sample size was not sufficient to allow multivariable analyses. Lastly, the policy of the Israeli Ministry of Health was to test only patients with symptoms that are suggestive of COVID-19. Thus, we have no information about ibuprofen in asymptomatic carriers, and whether antipyretics can influence their clinical course. A major strength of this study is the high response rate and nearly complete follow-up of patients admitted to a tertiary hospital. The balanced representation of the different severities of the disease, compatible with the distribution of disease in the Israeli population, is another strength.",

This led to the hypothesis that ACE2-stimulating drugs, such as ACE inhibitors and Ibuprofen, might increase the risk for severe and fatal COVID-19 disease [3]. Regarding ibuprofen, this hypothesis was not supported in our cohort. Larger prospective studies are needed to validate our results.",
