In 1993, O\u2019Grady and associates [8] proposed the terms hyperacute, acute, and subacute liver failure based on whether the interval between the appearance of encephalopathy and jaundice was 0\u20137 days, 8\u201328 days, or 29 days to 12 weeks, respectively. Both Bernuau and O\u2019Grady included cases of preexisting asymptomatic chronic liver conditions. In Japan, patients with fulminant hepatitis are classified into two types according to the onset of encephalopathy (before or after 10 days). Encephalopathy occurring after 8 weeks is defined as late-onset hepatic failure (LOHF) [9].",

For example, both the hyperacute and acute liver failure groups have a high incidence of cerebral edema. However, whereas patients in the hyperacute group are more likely to survive with medical management, patients in the acute liver failure group tend to die without liver transplantation [8]. The subacute failure group has a lower incidence of cerebral edema and a higher incidence of portal hypertension manifestations, including ascites and renal failure [8]. Mortality in this group remains high. O\u2019Grady and colleagues found that the hyperacute failure group had a 36% survival rate, as opposed to 7% and 14% in the acute and subacute failure cohorts, respectively [8]. Bernuau and coworkers also noted that those with the most rapid onset of encephalopathy had the best chance of survival [7]. Similar observations have been made in Japan [9]. However, it is important to note that although the interval between the onset of encephalopathy and jaundice was of prognostic significance in O\u2019Grady\u2019s cohort [1], it was not an independent prognostic factor in Bernuau\u2019s cohort [10], thus raising doubts about its universal applicability. Application of the O\u2019Grady classification to 423 prospectively studied patients from a tertiary care referral center in northern India failed to yield any prognostic differences between the groups [11].",

Loss of integrity of the hepatocyte plasma membrane secondary to chemical, immunologic, or a wide variety of other insults is thought to represent the final common pathway that leads to cell necrosis and ALF [13, 14]. Damage to the cell membrane permits leakage of enzymes, coenzymes, and electrolytes from the cytosol, followed by an influx of calcium ions, which eventually results in cell death. The importance of calcium is underscored by the finding that normally vulnerable hepatocytes in vitro do not succumb to the cytotoxic effects of membrane-active toxins when calcium ions are not included in the culture medium [15].",

Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) has been identified as exerting an inhibitory effect on hepatic regeneration, with its effects being counteracted by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). ALF patients with viral hepatitis have demonstrated an increase in total TGF-\u03b21 with a less elevated HGF level, thus suggesting an imbalance in growth factor interplay as a cause of impaired hepatic regeneration [16]. This mechanism has also been suggested by research performed in posttransplant patients [17]. Studies suggest that activation of the cytokine network may represent the common final pathway for the development of ALF [18]. Although multiple inflammatory cascades come into play, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 have been identified as the more important mediators, along with endotoxin and nitric oxide. In response to the initial hepatic insult, interplay among these mediators sets into motion a vicious self-perpetuating cycle resulting in continued hepatic injury and multiorgan failure. Furthermore, higher levels of circulating interleukin-8 and interferon-\u03b3 have been demonstrated in patients with ALF than in healthy volunteers and those with chronic liver disease, thus suggesting a pathogenic role in acute hepatic injury. Although no relationship was found between the levels of these two markers and the clinical course, elevated levels of interleukin-10 were found to be predictive of improved outcome [19].\n",

In the USA, drug-induced liver injury is responsible for almost 50% of ALF [21, 22] most often caused by APAP. In London, UK, APAP poisoning was responsible for 57% of ALF cases seen at King\u2019s College Hospital between 1973 and 1991, whereas in France, APAP was identified as the etiology in only 2% of ALF cases between 1972 and 1990 [23, 24]. A multicenter study from the USA of 295 patients in whom ALF was diagnosed between 1994 and 1996 found that the most common etiologies were APAP (20%), viral hepatitis (10% hepatitis B, 7% hepatitis A), cryptogenic (15%), and drug reactions (12%) [25]. Outside of the USA and Europe, drugs are less likely to cause ALF. In a Japanese study [26], the percentage of drug allergy-induced ALF in 432 patients collected in the period 1998\u20132006 was 2% in contrast to viral infection which was diagnosed as the cause in 16% of the patients (13% with hepatitis B). Even though APAP overdose was found to represent one-sixth of all causes of ALF leading to registration for liver transplantation in Europe, there was a 50-fold difference in the relative risk of ALF leading to registration for liver transplantation between countries with a low incident rate (e.g., Italy with 0.03 ALF per million inhabitants per year) and high incident rate (e.g., Ireland with 7.13 ALF per million inhabitants per year). The reasons for these differences remain unclear, but may be related to national differences in pack size restriction of APAP or antidote treatment regimens [27].",

The maximum daily approved dose may vary depending on the country, but is generally in the range of 80 mg/kg APAP for children and 3\u20134 g for adults. The minimum dose for toxicity from a single ingestion is generally 150 mg/kg for children and 7.5\u201310 g for adults [28]. Doses greater than 350 mg/kg almost always result in severe hepatotoxicity without antidotal treatment [23]. However, APAP toxicity is increasingly being recognized as a cause of ALF even when used in supratherapeutic doses, and such \u201ctherapeutic misadventures\u201d may represent the most common cause of ALF in the USA [29]. These cases usually occur when APAP is misused in the setting of chronic pain and alcohol use or less commonly with medications that induce the cytochrome P-450 system (e.g., isoniazid [INH], rifampin, phenytoin) or in the setting of starvation (depleted glutathione [GSH] stores) [30, 31]. High aminotransferase levels are typical of such cases, with values usually peaking above 4000 U/L and sometimes above 10,000 U/L.",

The resultant toxic metabolites covalently bind to important macromolecular constituents of the cell and prevent normal functioning or cause necrosis of the cell. Acetaminophen metabolism (Fig. 1) serves as a pertinent example. Most of the ingested APAP is conjugated with glucuronide or sulfate and excreted as a harmless metabolite [32, 33]. In therapeutic doses, approximately 5% of APAP is oxidized by the P-450 system to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), a toxic intermediate that is readily detoxified by reaction with GSH [32, 33]. An APAP overdose overwhelms the sulfation and glucuronidation pathways and drives the formation of NAPQI, detoxification of which depletes GSH stores [32, 33]. Once the binding capacity of GSH is exceeded, NAPQI covalently binds to key hepatocyte membrane and cellular proteins and causes necrosis [22, 23].\n",

For example, alcohol [34], INH [35], and possibly phenytoin [36] cause induction of the P-450 system, which enhances the conversion of APAP to NAPQI. In addition, alcohol inhibits the synthesis of GSH, thereby decreasing clearance of NAPQI [37]. Chronic alcohol abusers are also more likely to be malnourished and have an antecedent fasting period, which also depletes GSH stores. Thus, supratherapeutic doses of APAP in conjunction with regular alcohol use can result in elevated NAPQI levels and subsequent hepatic injury \u2013 the so-called therapeutic misadventure [38]. It is important to note that starvation, a GSH-depleted state, is an independent risk factor for a therapeutic misadventure with APAP, regardless of concurrent alcohol use. Another example of synergistic toxicity is noted in patients treated with INH and rifampin, where rifampin-induced cytochrome induction can potentiate INH hepatotoxicity [39].",

An increase in the incidence of mushroom poisoning is usually seen after periods of heavy rainfall or during the fall, when the conditions for growth are optimal. Ingestion of cyclopeptide-containing mushrooms accounts for up to 90% of mushroom-related deaths worldwide [50\u201354]. The genus Amanita is the source of most of these poisonings, especially A. phalloides (death cap), A. verna (death angel), and A. virosa (destroying angel). Galerina and species can also be hepatotoxic (see Table 2). Amanita species are found primarily in the temperate coastal regions of the west coast of the USA, but they have also adapted to the mid-Atlantic coast and the northeast. A. phalloides is the predominant hepatotoxic European mushroom. The mushroom itself has no distinct taste, smell, or appearance. Ingestion is usually followed 6\u201312 h later by fever, nausea, vomiting, and severe diarrhea. Renal and hepatic impairment may become evident by 24\u201348 h while the patient appears to be recovering clinically. However, renal failure and hepatic failure progress and tend to become severe by day 3\u20135, with the development of jaundice, encephalopathy, and possibly death. Liver transplantation has been carried out successfully for cases of severe Amanita poisoning [53]. Some Amanita mushrooms such as A. muscaria and A. pantherina do not contain hepatotoxins.",

Phallotoxins are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and therefore are not thought to play a role in the symptoms associated with human poisoning [55]. \u03b1-Amanitin is a dialyzable octapeptide that inhibits RNA polymerase II, thus interfering with mRNA synthesis [56]. The cell is robbed of its ability to produce vital structural proteins and undergoes necrosis. Tissues with a high rate of protein synthesis (liver, kidneys, brain) suffer the most damage [56]. \u03b1-Amanitin is easily absorbed from the intestinal epithelium and enters the hepatocyte via bile transport carriers [57]. It demonstrates low plasma protein binding and is cleared from plasma in 36 h [56, 57]. Sixty percent is excreted into bile and undergoes enterohepatic circulation, whereas the rest is cleared renally [55, 56] (see 10.1007/978-3-319-17900-1_117 for a more detailed discussion).",

The majority of cases are related to hepatitis A and E infections globally with death rates of more than 50% reported from the developing world [59, 60]. Also hepatitis B infection may lead to ALF [61]. It is unclear why ALF develops in a select proportion of the infected population, but historical review of previous epidemics reveals that this number remains surprisingly constant at approximately 0.4% [62]. The hepatocellular necrosis seen in cases of ALF caused by hepatitis A and B is thought to be due in part to a direct cytopathic effect of the virus. This mechanism is supported by the relative lack of inflammation seen in the livers of patients with viral ALF. However, the normal humoral and cell-mediated response to a massively infected liver also plays a role. One study found that the amount of hepatitis A virus (HAV) isolated from the livers of patients with HAV-associated ALF was higher than titers from patients with nonfulminant HAV hepatitis [63]. In addition, CD8+ T lymphocytes isolated from the livers of two patients with acute HAV infection demonstrated the ability to kill HAV-infected fibroblasts in culture, thus implying that the liver damage seen in virally induced ALF is in part cell mediated [64].",

            "text": "ALF secondary to HAV infection is a rare event: 0.35% of HAV infections will progress to ALF [58]. Patients have a comparatively low mortality rate (<40%) and usually recover without liver transplantation. Acute hepatitis B infection progresses to ALF in approximately 1% of infected patients, thus making hepatitis B virus (HBV) the most common viral cause of ALF [58]. Its role may be underestimated when the impact of infection with a pre-core mutant (HBV viral infection that does not produce the surface [HBsAg] or e antigen) is taken into account, as demonstrated by a study in which it was found that 35% of patients who underwent transplantation for non-A, non-B hepatitis had evidence of HBV infection by polymerase chain reaction [65]. One half to one third of patients with ALF secondary to HBV will clear HBsAg within a few days [66]; such rapid clearance is thought to be the result of a substantial immunologic response to HBV-laden hepatocytes. Interestingly, those who clear HBsAg rapidly have a more favorable prognosis (47% survival rate) than those with continued HBsAg positivity (17% survival rate) [13]. Despite being an increasingly common cause of chronic liver disease, isolated infection with hepatitis C virus has yet to be definitively implicated in ALF [10]. Though rarely encountered in the USA, infection with hepatitis E virus in pregnant women carries a 40% mortality rate [67]. Infection with hepatitis delta virus has been implicated in about 30% of HBV-related ALF cases. In fact, the risk of ALF increases dramatically with any hepatitis virus coinfection [68, 69].",

Prolonged hypotension after an overdose of opiates or cardioactive drugs (e.g., \u03b2-receptor or calcium channel antagonists) or cardiac arrest from any agent may also produce hepatic failure.

DIC and local fibrinolysis do occur in ALF, and though not usually severe, they can be exacerbated by infection or by the infusion of activated clotting factors [73]. Administration of fresh frozen plasma in the absence of bleeding is not recommended because it has not been shown to be of value [72] and will alter the prothrombin time, thus hindering patient assessment.

Seizures may occur. The initial stages of encephalopathy are secondary to bilateral forebrain dysfunction, with the latter being secondary to brainstem impairment. Table 4 delineates the grading system used for acute hepatic encephalopathy; the presence of stupor or coma portends a poorer prognosis. Although the exact pathogenesis remains elusive, the encephalopathy is reversible and thought to be metabolic. Structural changes such as those seen with Alzheimer\u2019s disease are not part of the syndrome. It is postulated that elevated levels of neuroactive humoral substances secondary to decreased hepatic clearance cause the observed mental status changes. It is important to note that the blood\u2013brain barrier is disrupted in ALF, and this increased permeability makes it unnecessary for a substance to be present in greater than normal concentration in plasma to affect cerebral function. In addition, with the blood\u2013brain barrier demonstrating marked regional differences in permeability, the concentration of potentially encephalopathic agents at critical subcellular sites may be more important than their concentration in cerebrospinal fluid or plasma [75]. Studies have implicated increased GABAergic (transmitting or secreting \u03b3-aminobutyric acid) tone, mediated by an endogenous benzodiazepine-like ligand, as a cause of the hepatic encephalopathy seen in ALF [76]. Treatment with flumazenil (a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) has been shown to temporarily improve the coma grade of patients suffering from this syndrome.\n\n",

Research indicates a complex interplay among vasogenic (alterations in blood flow), cytotoxic (loss of osmoregulation), and hydrocephalic (extracellular expansion) factors. Even though earlier histologic studies of the brain revealed no abnormalities [79], more recent data have found alterations in cell membrane integrity and blood\u2013brain barrier permeability [80, 81], changes probably responsible for the increased water content and weight of the brain. Although patients with cirrhosis rarely have cerebral edema, a marked decrease in intracranial blood flow has been noted in those with acute or chronic encephalopathy [82]. This decreased blood flow, along with the systemic hypotension commonly found in ALF (see the next section) and the increased ICP secondary to cerebral edema, predisposes the brain to ischemic injury. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = mean arterial pressure [MAP] \u2013 ICP) below 40\u201350 mmHg is associated with ischemic brain injury and can have permanent consequences, even if the liver recovers fully. A persistent and refractory perfusion pressure of less than 40 mmHg precludes transplantation [83]. Signs of increased ICP are noted in Table 5. Because they are manifested only late in the course of events (i.e., only if ICP is greater than 30 mmHg), these signs cannot be used to gauge the need for therapeutic intervention.\n",

However, with disease progression and depression of the central respiratory drive secondary to edema or circulating toxins, respiratory acidosis can develop. Hypokalemia is associated with metabolic alkalosis, whereas tissue hypoxia and massive hepatic necrosis give rise to metabolic acidosis with elevated levels of lactic acid, free fatty acid, and other organic acids. The presence of lactic acidosis is a poor prognostic indicator. Impaired glucose release, loss of glycogen reserves, and decreased gluconeogenesis are in combination responsible for severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose <40 mg/dL [2.2 mmol/L]) in up to 40% of patients. Decreased hepatic metabolism of insulin resulting in inappropriately elevated plasma insulin levels also plays a pathogenic role.

OLT is the best available option for the second cohort; it is not appropriate therapy for the first group. The difficulty lies in accurately categorizing patients into one of these two groups and doing so in a timely manner, before the complications associated with ALF preclude OLT as a therapeutic option. Overall, current estimates reveal that only about 10% of patients with ALF receive a transplant [106]. Posttransplant survival rates have been estimated at 55% to 75% [116], although rates may improve to over 90% with stringent selection criteria [108]. As noted earlier, ALF without OLT is associated with very high mortality rates, and survival remains dismal for those who are listed for transplantation but do not receive an organ in time. In general, transplantation is recommended if the patient\u2019s survival rate is estimated to be below 20%.",

The severity of encephalopathy at admission is inversely related to survival in patients with acetaminophen toxicity and acute liver failure [25]. Although age younger than 10 or older than 40 years has been shown to be a poor prognostic indicator in older studies, it did not play a role in survival rates from a more recent US series [25].

Severe acidosis (pH <7.3) in patients with APAP toxicity was associated with a mortality rate of 95%. Excluding acidosis, the presence of any other adverse characteristic in this population resulted in a mortality rate of at least 55%. These mortality rates are much higher than those associated with liver transplantation; thus, patients with even one negative prognostic indicator should be considered for listing [1].

Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores were similar to the King\u2019s College Criteria in identifying those needing transplantation, but patients were recognized earlier in a few cases [119]. Serum Gc-globulin and plasma factor V levels have been used independently to predict outcome; however, they are specialized laboratory tests that may not always be available and have not been shown to be any better than the King\u2019s College Criteria [120]. Factor V levels vary by age; transplantation is recommended for a factor V level less than 20% in ALF patients younger than 30 years or for a factor V level less than 30% for those older than 30 years [121]. However, patients have recovered without transplantation with factor V levels less than 10%, in our experience. Also measurement of arterial blood lactate may improve the speed and accuracy of selection of appropriate candidates for OLT. In a single-center study, the prediction of non-surviving APAP-induced ALF patients using lactate was similar to KCH criteria but identified them earlier [122]. Although early recognition of patients most likely to benefit from transplantation is important, it is equally important to recognize those in whom liver transplantation is contraindicated (Table 9).\n\n",

Recent research has focused on trying to reproduce the hepatic architecture in the ELAD cartridge, identifying the optimal hepatocyte mass needed to provide the best results, and determining the ideal perfusion time necessary for a favorable outcome. The most extensively studied nonbiological device is the molecular adsorbent recirculating system which has shown some evidence in case series to improve biochemical parameters [125].",
