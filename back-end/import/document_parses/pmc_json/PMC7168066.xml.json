Clinical examination revealed oropharingeal erythema, red strawberry tongue, cheilitis, and a severe itchy erythema of the trunk that extended to the arms and legs, covered with hundreds of white micropustules. Inguinal folds were spared, as the abdominal one. Somewhere small islands of intact skin were seen intermingled with affected skin (Fig. 1a).",

The boy was given ampicillin\u2013sulbactam 150 mg/kg, and a bland emollient lotion was used on the body surface. On the third day, fever subsided and general conditions started to improve (Fig. 1c). The skin completely healed by desquamation in 10 days. Laboratory investigations showed leukocytosis (14 \u00d7 109/l) with striking neutrophilia (up to 9.9 \u00d7 109/l) and elevated CRP (94.3 mg/l). Tests for influenza A and B virus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, RSV, mycoplasma pneumonia, CMV, EBV, Group A streptococcus pyogenes, and toxoplasma gondii were all negative. Only Group A streptococci on throat swab was found positive. Due to the rapid healing, no skin biopsy was carried out.",
