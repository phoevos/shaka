In the first study,\n17\n treatment with the combination resulted in 100% virological cure on day 6 post inclusion in the combination arm (n = 6), compared with 57.1% virological cure in the HCQ alone arm (n = 14) and 12.5% virological cure in the control arm (n = 16). In the second study also,\n24\n they found virological clearance (total sample size = 80) in 83% of patients on day 7. Treatment with HCQ resulted in a shorter duration of hospital stay.\n24\n However the six patients in the first study were also included in the second study. In the third study by the same group,\n23\n virological cure was seen among 91.7% of the patients on day 10 with a very low mortality rate (0.47%). On the contrary, Molina et al,\n26\n failed to replicate the findings of the obtained by Gautret et al.\n17\n However, in the study by Molina et al,\n26\n the patient population also had significant comorbidities (cancer, HIV, and obesity) and the patient population included belonged to severe COVID\u201019 category. We need further controlled studies for an effective conclusion.",
