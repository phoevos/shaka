A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the causative pathogen (Ksiazek et al., 2003). It trigged fever, dry cough, pulmonary infiltrates, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia with a mortality rate of 10%. Sporadic cases of SARS-CoV infections due to laboratory exposure were reported after the global outbreak ended. The mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV infections and clinical manifestation remain poorly understood. The high lethality of SARS and its enormous economic and social impacts have highlighted the importance of elucidating the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection.",

It is associated with SARS-CoV infection and characterized by pulmonary oedema, accumulation of inflammatory cells and resulting severe hypoxia. ARDS can initiate the activation of local inflammatory mediators that eventually spill over into the general circulation and resulting a systemic inflammatory response (SIR) (Bhatia and Moochhala, 2004). As a consequence of SIR, an excessive cytokine-mediated systemic leukocytes activation will lead to the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Owing to the development of ARDS, SARS-CoV infected patients often suffered from MODS, thus explaining its high mortality. Therefore, it is crucial to elucidate the key inflammatory mediators in ARDS to characterize novel therapeutic targets ultimately aiming to stop or ameliorate the disease progression.",

In this study, we characterize the inflammatory mediators involved in the development of ARDS in SARS-CoV infected patients by investigating the gene expression profiles linked to the physiopathological changes occurring in the lung. We show 26 genes that are significantly up-regulated and 5 genes that are significantly down-regulated in the progression of the disease. These genes greatly improve the knowledge of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infections and contribute towards the development of therapeutic interventions for this fatal disease and perhaps, for ARDS as a whole.",

It is a major constituent of neutrophils with anti-inflammatory properties and plays an integral part in innate immunity (Elsbach, 1998). Interleukin-8 (IL-8), another gene that is significantly over-expressed in disease samples, has been reported to cause airway inflammation and plays the role as neutrophilic activator in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis. IL-8 has been also shown to up-regulate in the lung samples of SARS-CoV infected macaques (de Lang et al., 2007). Reports by Aichele et al. (2006) showed both BPI and IL-8 were released from neutrophils in a time-dependent manner following bacterial encounter in cystic fibrosis patients. In accordance to these studies, our data demonstrates up-regulation of BPI and IL-8 in SARS-CoV infections, presumably in an attempt to activate the immune response to combat the SARS-CoV infections.",
