This review aims to provide a summary of the current literature regarding common medications prescribed in orthopaedic surgery and their potential implications in COVID-19 patients. These medications include analgesia, anti-inflammatories, steroids, anticoagulants, antibiotics, vitamin B, vitamin C and vitamin D.",

All clinical studies, reviews, consensus and guidelines related to the above medications and COVID-19 were included. Decision was made to include review articles and international consensus due to the limited number of clinical studies available related to COVID-19. The evidence and studies quoted in the reviews, consensus and guidelines are included and discussed as well. Editorials, letter to editors and opinion pieces were excluded from the review because these represent individual viewpoints. Publications not related to COVID-19, publications not related to medications, publications on medications not prescribed by Orthopaedic surgery, non-English studies and articles with no full text available were excluded. The articles were selected in two stages. Firstly, the abstracts identified by the above searches were downloaded, and the list was screened using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Secondly, the full texts of this shortlisted list were downloaded and assessed for eligibility. The reference lists of the publications were then hand-searched for additional relevant studies. This process was repeated twice independently. A total of 18 articles were included.",

These include paracetamol (acetaminophen), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids. Paracetamol is mainly used in orthopaedic surgery for its analgesic and antipyretic properties, even though it does exhibit weak anti-inflammatory effects. NSAIDs are used for its analgesia, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties, particularly in inflammatory arthropathy, osteoarthritis and inflamed muscles or tendons. NSAIDs are also used in the prophylaxis and treatment of heterotopic ossification, and specific NSAIDs, such as aspirin, can also be used for its antiplatelet properties. Opioids are primarily used in orthopaedic surgery for its analgesic properties, though it can also be used for its procedural sedation, such as for manipulation and reduction of fractures.",

This started following reports and guidelines that have associated the use of anti-inflammatory medications to an increased incidence of COVID-19 infections [3]. These have been postulated due to the interaction of NSAIDs with angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE) [3, 4]. NSAIDs have also been stated to possibly mask the symptoms of infection, delaying diagnosis [3]. However, subsequent investigations have revealed that there are no published studies that have found an actual association between the use of anti-inflammatory medication to an increased incidence or worsening COVID-19 infections [3, 4]. In fact, a previous in vitro and in vivo study that investigated the effect of indomethacin on coronavirus suggested that indomethacin exhibited potent antiviral activity by inhibiting viral replication and protecting the host cell from virus-induced damage [7]. Subsequent reports and guidelines, including the WHO statement, have therefore published official statements recommending not to avoid the use of NSAIDs based on the current available evidence [3\u20136].",

Opioids are recognized to have the potential to suppress the immune system, with a possible increase risk in the incidence and severity of infections, though the relevance in COVID-19 is still unclear currently [2]. The international panel then recommend that amongst the opioids, buprenorphine appears to be safest for use in immunocompromised or elderly patients susceptible to infections, while morphine and fentanyl are observed to be the most immunosuppressive [2]. Additionally, it is also important to note that the potential for respiratory depression is higher in febrile patients using fentanyl patches, as fever increases the absorption [2].",

Potential advantages for the use of steroids include the ability of the steroids to reduce immunopathological damage and alleviate the early pro-inflammatory response, while potential disadvantages include delayed viral clearance and the adverse effects of avascular necrosis, diabetes and psychosis as evident from SARS and MERS [1, 3\u20136, 8], In view of the lack of survival benefit and possible harms, WHO, in their guidelines for the management of COVID-19 patients, therefore, has recommended against the use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of viral pneumonia [8]. They further recommended for clinicians who are considering the use of steroids for COVID-19 patients with sepsis to balance the potential for a small reduction in mortality in surviving sepsis with the potential downside of the possible harms indicated [8].",

Firstly, orthopaedic surgeons prescribing steroids for COVID-19 patients are recommended to weigh the utility of the steroids against the potential risks. However, while WHO recommend against the use of systemic steroids for the treatment of viral pneumonia, WHO does not stop the usage of steroids for other evidence-based reasons. Therefore, patients with conditions where steroids are proven to have efficacious outcomes, such as that of spinal metastases with cord compression or cauda equina, can continue to receive their steroids. Secondly, WHO has also not issued a statement regarding intra-articular steroids, and the effects of intra-articular steroids on COVID-19 have also not been evaluated in other studies before; therefore orthopaedic surgeons can continue using intra-articular steroids for pain relief when required after weighing the risks and benefits. Thirdly, it is also important for orthopaedic surgeons who are following up on COVID-19 patients with steroids usage to follow them long term and evaluate for the possibility of avascular necrosis.",

The only publication that discussed the use of anti-coagulation in the use of COVID-19 patients is a letter to editor [9]. No clinical studies, reviews, consensus and guidelines are published regarding the use of anti-coagulation in COVID-19 patients. The authors in the letter recommend replacing oral anti-coagulant therapies with parental heparin when the patients are hospitalized for COVID-19 [9]. They recommend against the use of vitamin K antagonists due to the high instability of the prothrombin time in view of variations with vitamin K metabolism in face of the illness, fluctuation in nutrition and possible heart and liver impairment [9]. They also highlighted on the potential drug-drug interactions that might alter the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of direct oral anticoagulants, including antivirals, antibiotics and immunosuppressive drugs that might be prescribed for COVID-19 patients [9]. Accordingly, orthopaedic surgeons prescribing anti-coagulants are recommended to prescribe either low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin for COVID-19 patients, instead of oral anti-coagulation, whenever possible.",

This is important as the literature is currently brimming with multiple publications regarding COVID-19, making it difficult for the orthopaedic surgeons to sieve through the scores of publications to distil important information regarding the potential implications of their drug prescriptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic review was therefore conducted to summarize the important information. However, owing to the limited number of clinical studies available for COVID-19, all clinical studies, reviews, consensus, guidelines and their relevant evidence were included and discussed in the current review.",

Firstly, paracetamol remains the first line of analgesia and antipyretic for COVID-19 patients. Secondly, there is no need to avoid NSAIDs for COVID-19 patients based on the current available literature. Thirdly, opioids have the potential for immunosuppression in addition to respiratory depression and, therefore, should be prescribed with care in COVID-19 patients, with buprenorphine appearing to be the safest for use in the immunocompromised or elderly patients susceptible to infections. Fourthly, patients with conditions where steroids are proven to be efficacious can continue to receive their steroids; otherwise, systemic steroids are not recommended for COVID-19 patients in view of the potential risks. Fifthly, orthopaedic surgeons following up on patients with COVID-19 who are using steroids should continue following up these patients for a longer duration in view of possible avascular necrosis. Sixthly, whenever possible, oral anticoagulation should be converted to parental heparin to minimize overtreatment or undertreatment with oral anticoagulation. Seventhly, common orthopaedic antibiotics including penicillin and clindamycin are safe to continue for COVID-19 patients. However, for COVID-19 patients, the antibiotics can potentially be switched to macrolides and tetracyclines if the organisms are sensitive to these antibiotics, so as to cover for the orthopaedic infection while potentially having therapeutic effects on the COVID-19 infection as well. Lastly, vitamins B, C and D potentially have therapeutic benefits for COVID-19 patients, and therefore, prescription for these vitamins should continue as per usual clinical practice.",
