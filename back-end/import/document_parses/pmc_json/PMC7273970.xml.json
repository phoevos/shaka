Currently, there is no evidence from randomized clinical trials that any specific therapy improves outcomes in patients with COVID-19 (1). Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are considered to be promising repurposed drugs against COVID-19, based on pathophysiological considerations and in vitro results (2, 3). These drugs have received particular attention as they are widely available and inexpensive. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, quinine-related compounds, have been used for the treatment of malaria and chronic inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. The anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties may account for the efficacy in treating patients with COVID-19 infection (4). There have been reports that patients who received chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine had faster virological clearance (5, 6), however there are some limitations of the studies such as small sample size and questionable methodology. There is no high-quality evidence of potential benefit of these drugs at the moment. Presently, there are over 80 registered ongoing trials worldwide examining the role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 treatment (7).",

The clinical and research literature also contains reports of ototoxic effects after chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine treatment. Ototoxicity refers to drug-related injury causing damage to the inner ear structures, which then result in hearing loss and/or tinnitus (the subjective perception of sound such as ringing, hissing, or buzzing, without an external source), and/or imbalance (9). Permanent hearing loss can adversely affect cognitive health (10) and mental well-being (11). Troublesome tinnitus is associated with insomnia, poor concentration, anxiety and depression (12). The mechanisms of chloroquine associated hearing loss include cochlear outer hair cell dysfunction, and inhibition of post synaptic sodium channel function in cochlear spiral ganglion cells (13). Additionally, some alterations in central auditory function, which may trigger tinnitus, have been observed after quinine administration (13).",

A prospective observational study in 2015 concluded that ototoxic effects of chloroquine at regular doses for malaria treatment (1.2 g daily for 3 days) were fully reversible (14). Sensorineural hearing loss after chloroquine in a 6-year old girl was partially reversible after prednisolone administration (19). However, permanent severe sensorineural hearing loss has also been reported in 2 cases (17, 20). Additionally, reversible chloroquine-induced cochlear injury was detectable by brainstem audiometry in 13 out of 70 patients despite normal pure tone audiogram results (18). Tinnitus has also been reported concurrently with persistent hearing loss in 1 case (20). Imbalance was reported in 3 cases (14, 19, 20).",

Most of the studies on this topic were case series or case reports with only a few observational studies. Information from a definitive large study with good methodology is still lacking. Ototoxicity after chloroquine use tends to be more sudden, while hydroxychloroquine is more likely to cause ototoxicity after prolonged use. This could be due to different drug efficacy and equivalent dosage. Furthermore, hearing loss in these patients could be associated with other possible causes rather than chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine including autoimmune disease e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus (30), sudden sensorineural hearing loss or presbycusis.",

There is no information regarding the ototoxic effect of chloroquine at this higher dose. Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases were treated with a usual dose of hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily for long durations (months or years). A suggested dose of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 infection is an initial loading dose of 800 mg followed by 400 mg daily for 4 days based on the in vitro model (2), and 600 mg daily for 10 days from a French study (6).

            "text": "Due to the potentially substantial number of the world's population who may take chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, there is the prospect of a significant number of people being affected with ototoxic side effects. It is therefore vital to build awareness about the presentation and impact of the symptoms of drug-induced ototoxicity. Patient reports of hearing loss, tinnitus, or imbalance should be noted. Those with troublesome hearing loss or tinnitus are encouraged to be referred for hearing evaluation, including extended high frequencies audiometry at 8\u201316 kHz where possible, once they are stable. Available options of audiological interventions for those with bothersome hearing impairment or tinnitus are counseling, hearing aids, and tinnitus therapy. The possibility of exacerbation of pre-existing hearing loss and/or tinnitus should be considered. Synergistic adverse auditory effects when other ototoxic medication is administered with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, such as aminoglycoside antibiotics and azithromycin, is a further risk (9). Severe cases of COVID-19 can also progress to respiratory distress and hypoxia (31). Hypoxia is known to have deleterious effects on the stria vascularis of the cochlea organ including alterations to cochlear potentials and histologic changes (32). Therefore, it is certainly possible that the combined effects of hypoxia and administration of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine on hearing could be worse than either one alone. Clinical trials of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine should also consider including audiological monitoring in the protocol. Ideally, a hearing test should be conducted both before and after drug administration to examine drug-induced hearing change. Common methods for audiological evaluation include pure tone audiometry, otoacoustic emission (OAE), and tinnitus questionnaire. However, conventional methods and setting of hearing evaluation is impractical based on the infectious nature of COVID-19 and the urgency of drug administration. Self-monitoring by validated smartphone-based apps for hearing assessments in addition to self-report of symptoms is an approach of interest in this situation.",
