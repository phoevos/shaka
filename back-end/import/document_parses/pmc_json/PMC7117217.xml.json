The reproductive component of the disease syndrome can be routinely reproduced under experimental conditions (Terpstra et al., 1991, Collins et al., 1991, Christianson et al., 1992, Plana et al., 1992). Although respiratory disease is a major component of the syndrome in field cases (Keffaber, 1990), clinical signs of respiratory disease have not been consistently reproduced under experimental conditions. Histopathological lesions consistent with those seen in field cases of PRRS have been reproduced experimentally in gnotobiotic pigs (Collins et al., 1991, Collins et al., 1992) and in Cesarean derived, colostrum deprived pigs (Pol et al., 1991). It has been postulated that the lack of clinical signs of pneumonia may be due to the absence of bacterial pathogens (Collins et al., 1992).",

            "text": "Subclinically infected pigs are considered the most common source of new S. choleraesuis infections. A carrier state was demonstrated in which pigs experimentally inoculated with S. choleraesuis remained persistently infected for at least 12 weeks (Gray et al., 1995). While respiratory disease is a common sequela of acute S. choleraesuis infection, the factors that contribute to its development remain largely undefined. A variety of stressors, including the presence of viral disease, have been suggested to potentiate or exacerbate clinical outbreaks of salmonellosis (Schwartz, 1991). Exacerbation of infectious diseases, including S. choleraesuis, has been attributed to concurrent infection with PRRSV. Salmonella choleraesuis was one of several common secondary infections reportedly associated with herds chronically infected with PRRSV (Joo and Dee, 1993). Increases in the incidence and severity of salmonellosis and other diseases in association with PRRSV infections have been recognized in Britain (Done and Paton, 1995). Investigators demonstrated a positive association between the seroprevalence of PRRSV and infection with porcine respiratory corona virus or porcine influenza virus (Groschup et al., 1993). Stevenson et al. (1993) suggested that concurrent PRRSV infections were responsible for increased nursery mortality due to S. choleraesuis septicemia. However, few controlled studies have shown an interaction between PRRSV and a secondary infection. Galina et al. (1994) inoculated 13-day-old pigs with Streptococcus suis seven days after inoculation with PRRSV. The dually infected pigs developed suppurative meningitis, mononuclear perivascular cuffing in the brain, while non-inoculated and S. suis-only inoculated pigs did not. Shimizu et al. (1994) reported increased severity of Mycoplasma hyorhinis pneumonia five days after PRRSV. However, only two pigs were used in each group.",

Inoculation with S. choleraesuis resulted in a higher proportion of pigs with fevers over a longer period of time. In contrast, PRRSV alone produced a relatively high proportion of pigs with fevers but only for a short period of time. Although the anti-inflammatory affects of dexamethasone might be expected to moderate rather than contribute to a fever response, it seemed to increase the fever response in S. choleraesuis infected pigs to a greater degree than concurrent infection with PRRSV. This may be due to the enhanced level of S. choleraesuis infection in these pigs.",

The level and duration of shedding of S. choleraesuis for the SPN and SND groups tended to be less than SPD and greater than SNN pigs. Extrapolated into field conditions, the prolonged and elevated shedding of S. choleraesuis seen in SPD pigs would be expected to provide higher and longer levels of exposure of S. choleraesuis to herdmates, thereby providing a mechanism for more severe disease. Other research has shown higher infectious doses of S. choleraesuis results in more severe clinical disease (Gray et al., 1996b). These results in combination with evidence of more widely systemic infections at necropsy also suggest pigs concurrently infected with PRRSV and subjected to stress were less resistant to spread of S. choleraesuis and may be more susceptible to overwhelming infections with the bacteria. This mechanism would support clinical observations that a variety of stressors, including other viral infections, exacerbate clinical outbreaks of salmonellosis (Schwartz, 1991). It would also support suggestions that PRRSV was associated with increasing the clinical effects of salmonellosis in the field (Stevenson et al., 1993).",

            "text": "The potential for PRRSV to modulate the host immune system, at least locally, is supported by the fact that the virus replicates preferentially in macrophages and results in their destruction (Wensvoort et al., 1991, Pol and Wagenaar, 1992). A significant decrease in the proportion of PAMs has been observed in pigs following PRRSV infection. This may have major consequences on defense mechanisms and susceptibility to secondary infections. Under experimental conditions, the proportion of alveolar macrophages in lung lavage decreased from >95% of total cells collected to approximately 50% by Day 7 post challenge (Molitor et al., 1992, Zhou et al., 1992). In addition, alterations in the function of pulmonary macrophages were also observed after PRRS virus infection. The production of inflammatory cytokines by alveolar macrophages, such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor, was enhanced and nonspecific bactericidal activity of the cells was suppressed (Zhou et al., 1992). In addition to PAMs, pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIMs) are susceptible to PRRSV infection (Thanawongnuwech et al., 1997). PIMs play an important role in the clearance of bacteria and particulates from blood (Winkler, 1988). Thanawongnuwech et al. (1997) found that intravascular macrophages are susceptible to PRRSV infection and infection was detrimental to their bactericidal activity. In a follow-up study, it was demonstrated that PRRSV infection impaired the ability of intravascular macrophages to clear blood-borne particles (Bautista et al., 1999). Since PIMs play a critical role in the clearance of foreign bodies from the blood stream, decreased function may make pigs more susceptible to bacterial infection, septicemia, and clinical disease. This would provide a partial explanation for the observed synergism between PRRSV and S. choleraesuis.",

However, the occurrence of pneumonia associated with S. choleraesuis infection in swine has increased in recent years and is also considered a common clinical manifestation of infection (Turk et al., 1992). Experimental studies have demonstrated S. choleraesuis pneumonia using intranasal inoculation (Baskerville and Dow, 1973, Gray et al., 1995). In addition to inducing pneumonia, studies have demonstrated that the respiratory exposure is an important route of infection in swine and can result in systemic infection and enterocolitis as well as a carrier state with S. choleraesuis and Salmonella typhimurium (Fedorka-Cray et al., 1995, Gray et al., 1995). It is likely that lowered numbers of PAMs and decreased PIMs antimicrobial activity as a result of a PRRSV infection will serve to exacerbate S. choleraesuis infection. This was demonstrated in this study with the SPN group showing decreased ADG, increased fecal shedding, and increased tissue dissemination when compared to the SNN group.",

Stress is a factor that is elusive to measure but is believed to play an important role in PRRSV infections, as well as many other infections including S. choleraesuis. Because of its anti-inflammatory effects, dexamethasone might be expected to moderate some of the clinical affects of infection. However, the treatment clearly potentiated both the PRRSV and the Salmonella infections, as it was designed to do. We observed the most profound effects of each individual pathogen when it was combined with the dexamethasone and the most severe clinical effects when all three factors were combined. The higher febrile response observed when Salmonella was combined with dexamethasone is somewhat contradictory when considered with the decreased monocyte activity expected by this anti-inflammatory agent. However, the treatment combination also resulted in a more disseminated Salmonella infection that would provide increased levels of pyrogenic endotoxin.",
