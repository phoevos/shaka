            "text": "Every year around 2\u20133 million Muslims from over 180 countries arrive in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for a pilgrimage to the holy places of Islam [1]. The crowded conditions within a confined area in close contact with others leads to a high risk of pilgrims acquiring and spreading infectious diseases during their time in Saudi Arabia [2]. Respiratory tract infections are the most common infections affecting pilgrims [3], and the \u2018\u2018Hajj cough\u2019\u2019 is considered by pilgrims almost de rigueur\n[4]. Attack rates of respiratory symptoms of about 50\u201390% have been recorded among pilgrims from various nationalities [5], [6], [7]. Early reports from the 1978 Hajj season indicated that upper tract respiratory infections already formed the bulk of the work-load of medical teams attending pilgrims [8]. Recent data indicate that 60% of ill pilgrims consulting at Mina primary health structures suffer respiratory tract infections [9]. Respiratory tract infection is the leading cause of hospitalization in Saudi Hospitals during the Hajj, up to 57% in one study [10]. Pneumonia accounts for 30\u201340% of hospitalizations in tertiary care structures [10], [11] and for 27% of admission in intensive care units where they are responsible for 55% of sepsis [12], [13] during the Hajj.",

The onset of symptoms was rapid following arrival in Saudi Arabia and persistent symptoms were observed in one out of two pilgrims despite extensive use of antibiotics. The \u201cHajj cough\u201d affected all individuals independently on their age, comorbidities, vaccination status and use of individual non-pharmaceutical preventive measures against respiratory tract infections. Female were more likely than men to suffer Hajj cough and we have no explanation for this observation. Fortunately, the disease was mild with a low rate of hospitalization and complications. Microbiological studies based on PCR detection in respiratory samples were conducted among same cohorts of French pilgrims in the years 2012 and 2013 before departing from France and just prior to leaving Saudi Arabia [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. We observed a high rate of acquisition of viruses, notably rhinovirus, coronavirus E229 and, influenza virus A(H3N2) to a less extent and of Streptococcus pneumoniae. A large study based on the same protocol was conducted in 2013 among pilgrims from different nationalities and confirmed these results. It also showed a significant acquisition of Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae\n[21]. Sampling at the time of symptoms was conducted in a small subset of French pilgrims in 2012 only and included a restrictive panel of pathogens so that no strong conclusions can be drawn on the role of the respective microbes in the pathogeneses of the \u201cHajj cough\u201d. Nevertheless, both clinical and microbiological data indicate that transmission of respiratory pathogens in the context of the Hajj is highly frequent, which is likely the result of overcrowding with a density of 6\u20138 people per square meter close in certain areas in the Grand Mosque [22]. It is also likely that housing conditions in large collective tents at Mina encampment play a role in the transmission of respiratory viruses [23]. Finally, air pollutants may play a role through their irritant effect since an increase of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and tropospheric ozone levels is observed during Hajj compared to non-Hajj periods [24]. Physicians must be alert to the circulation of common pathogens at the Hajj, which silently cause much more casualties than the newcomer like Middle-East Respiratory syndrome (MERS) Coronavirus which occupy the forefront of the stage and get all the headlines, despite only 8 Umrah-associated MERS cases over an estimated 20 million pilgrims who visited Mecca from 2012 through 2014 [25], [26].",

            "text": "At the moment, none of the usual preventive measures against respiratory tract infection have been proven effective, including vaccination against influenza which is recommended for all Hajj pilgrims by French authorities and vaccination against pneumococcal infections which is recommended for at risk pilgrims suffering chronic conditions and or for those aged 60 years and over [27]. The \u201cHajj cough\u201d seems therefore inevitable and self-treatment should be provided to pilgrims at pre-travel advice. We suggest symptomatic treatment, using cough suppressants such as dextromethorphan, decongestants to relieve nasal congestion such as phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine, with careful use among patients with hypertension, and paracetamol for symptomatic treatment of fever, myalgia and sore throat. The use of antibiotics is questionable since the respective causality of bacteria and viruses in the pathogenesis of the \u201cHajj cough\u201d is not fully established. Nevertheless, prescription of antibiotics to Hajj pilgrims suffering mild respiratory symptoms is frequent in local health care structures: 95\u201399% patients consulting at the Ear, Nose and Throat clinic of a Hospital in Mecca were prescribed antibiotics while 85\u201392% presented with upper tract respiratory infection including pharyngitis and tonsillitis [28], [29]. Similarly, patients consulting at various primary health care centers in Mina found that 54% patients were prescribed antibiotics while 61% suffered respiratory tract infection with pharyngitis and the common cold the most frequent [9]. A cohort survey conducted among Iranian pilgrims in 2007 showed that 84% experienced respiratory symptoms and that 72% took antibiotics [30]. In a cohort survey conducted among Indonesian pilgrims, 63% suffered ILI during their stay in the KSA, of which 94% took antibiotics that were mostly obtained over the counter [31]. A recent cohort survey showed that 35% pilgrims from Australia used antibiotics during their stay, the main reason being upper respiratory tract infection. Thirty percent obtained antibiotics from a local pharmacy without prescription and 48% pre-emptively carried an antibiotic with them from Australia [32]. The apparent overall overuse of antibiotics by pilgrims is of concern with regards to the development of drug resistance. In this context, the development of point-of-care diagnostic tests would further enhance the ability to differentiate bacterial from viral infections and so decrease antibiotic use [33].",
