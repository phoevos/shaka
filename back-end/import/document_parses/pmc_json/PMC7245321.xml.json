            "text": "On January 30th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and on March 11th it was declared a global pandemic.1 By May 19th, 216 countries, areas or territories worldwide had reported almost 5 million cases of coronavirus disease.2 Preventive measures to flatten the epidemic curve have been implemented, thereby avoiding a demand surge on the healthcare system. Alongside the need to guarantee the supply of key medical and personal protective equipment to control the disease, there is a general concern regarding the preservation of the continued supply of medicines for all citizens.3, 4, 5 Although no major disruptions in pharmaceutical access have been reported thus far, the existing issue of medicine shortages6, 7, 8, 9 may increase, due to the worldwide state of public health emergency. Expected constraints in the manufacturing process (e.g. lockdown of factories due to quarantine) and supply chain disruptions can affect countries' ability to ensure patients' access to pharmacological therapies. Moreover, people's behavior is known to change during an epidemic.10 Its constraints can lead to states of anxiety, hoarding of medical supplies and rioting.11 As a result, an increase in the demand for medicines is anticipated, which may enhance the issue of drug shortages, acknowledged for having a negative impact on population welfare, leading to higher demand in healthcare resources and increased morbidity and mortality.12\n",

About two-months after the first confirmed cases in Portugal, hydroxychloroquine shortages remain high, which suggests pharmacies still struggle to fulfill these orders.

When it comes to data collection, as monthly medicine sales are validated in the second half of the following month, the presented values for April are provisional estimates. However, the amount of sales removed by the validation process is extremely low, which allows the use of these estimates for analyses without the risk of major differences in data. Unfulfilled pharmacy orders were used as a proxy of medicine shortages, thus do not represent a direct report from patients, but can be used to study trends as all pharmacies report them the same way. Also, since medicine shortages are dependent on the pharmacists' direct report, it is important to consider that, in this period, pharmacies are working under very controlled conditions (e.g. reduced teams) and therefore may not report all their unfulfilled orders, i.e., this registry may suffer from underreporting. Regarding data analysis, namely the analysis of the INNs, it was assumed that the medicine sales and shortages registered on the first week of March were representative of the pre-COVID-19 period values, as this can be observed for the total medications\u2019 market (Fig. 2).",
